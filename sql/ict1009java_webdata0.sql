At about 11.20am on Thursday (Feb 8), Johor police said Mr Dominick Tan and Ms Clarice Lum Jie had been spotted by a helicopter at Ulu Choh Pontian, which is near a lake. The duo had said during a distress call earlier that they were near a body of water. As the helicopter was unable to land in the area, a boat was deployed to pick them up. Authorities said the pair, both 27, suffered minor injuries and were taken to Pontian Hospital. A boat was deployed on Thursday morning (Feb 8) to rescue the two Singaporeans who had been missing at the Gunung Pulai forest reserve since Monday. (Photos: Johor police) Advertisement Advertisement Hospital staff said the two were suffering from dehydration as well as minor cuts and bruises. Both have since left the hospital, accompanied by their families, with Mr Tan seen walking out with a slight limp at about 2pm.

(Photo: Amir Yusof) Johor police chief Mohd Khalil Kader Mohd had said in a media briefing on Wednesday that it had never taken this long to find anyone reported missing in the Gunung Pulai Forest Reserve. The pair could have lost their way because they went off-track and did not use a route usually taken by climbers, he said. Mr Tan was said to be an experienced mountain climber who had hiked Gunung Pulai many times. \"WE WANT TO HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN\" Head of operations for Malaysia’s Mountain Search and Rescue Team (MOSAR) Abdul Rahman Mustafa said he was “very relieved” the two climbers were found. “In my experience, it becomes very difficult after the second day,\" he told Channel NewsAsia.

They’re human beings and we want to help in any way we can,\" he said. Singapore volunteer Steven Tan, who headed search operations for the climbing group Team 1000 Adventure, told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday morning that it was heartening to see so many Singaporeans taking time off work to participate. “The response was so positive. We had more than 20 volunteers from Singapore both yesterday and today,” said Mr Tan. A record of the rescuers\' conversation with the missing Singaporeans via telephone.

After spending more than S$150 on a grocery shopping trip in Johor Baru, Channel NewsAsia’s Amir Yusof tested how easy it is to pay at Woodlands Checkpoint.

Throughout the meandering lines of cars and motorcycles, drivers vented their frustrations with random, pointless honking and flashing lights. The tension was palpable, with people wanting to navigate their way through as quickly as possible. The situation was not helped when I told the auxiliary officer checking my car boot that I wanted to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the groceries I bought during my afternoon trip to JB. Inside the Tesco tote bags were groceries worth S$197.66. (Photo: Amir Yusof) “Err … can I see your receipts please,” said the young man, after glancing at the three Tesco supermarket tote bags filled with fruit, sporting goods and baby milk powder. I knew that the total value of my shopping spree was RM590 (S$197.66) - more than the S$150 of goods I could bring back after less than 48 hours out of Singapore without paying GST. I passed him the receipts before taking a cursory glance at the driver of the blue BMW next in line behind me. If looks could kill, I would have been dead instantly. Advertisement Advertisement After about five minutes, the officer at the passport booth directed me to another officer who had magically appeared next to my car, talking into his walkie-talkie. He motioned me to follow him to a separate area, before instructing me to park. “Don’t forget your wallet,” he said, pointing me to a Singapore Customs booth, where four or five people were already queueing. A man in line told me he had bought a table from IKEA and “had no choice” but to declare it, while a woman in the queue looked exasperated. Her car boot was filled to the brim with white boxes and an officer told her: “Sorry I’m afraid I have to hand this over to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).” After another ten minutes of standing in line, I was told that the GST due for my purchases amounted to S$3.20. I paid by NETS and was waved off by the officer with a brochure with information on duty-free concessions and GST tax relief. All in all, it took me 20 minutes to pay for GST, on top of the usual 45-minute evening peak hour jam. SOME SHOPPERS ADMIT TO EVADING GST For some Singaporean grocery shoppers I spoke to at Tesco Extra Tebrau City earlier in the day, paying GST at the land checkpoints is too much of a hassle. They admitted to sneaking in small-sized items such as groceries, handbags and wallets as they thought they would not get caught by officers at both the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. A 49-year-old engineer, who wanted to be known only as Khalid, said that he would travel up to Johor Baru every week just to buy groceries in bulk for his family. He has never paid GST. Shoppers at Tesco Hypermarket Tebrau City. (Photo: Amir Yusof) “It can cost up to RM600 (S$199) each time. I buy everything – detergent, fruits, vegetables, milk for the kids,” said Khalid. “I know I have to pay GST but I have never got stopped before (at the Checkpoint). Maybe it’s because everything is relatively small and in plastic bags,” he said. According to the Singapore Customs website, all goods brought into Singapore – including new items, souvenirs, gifts or food products – are subject to 7 per cent GST. However, travellers can enjoy GST relief on goods meant for their personal use depending on the time spent away from Singapore. For travellers who are away for 48 hours or more, the value of goods granted for GST relief is S$600, with those out of the country for less than 48 hours subject to the lower threshold of S$150. Cashiers at Tesco Extra supermarket in Tebrau City. (Photo: Amir Yusof) Singaporean shopper Kelvin Cheng, 28, told me he was aware that other shoppers use creative ways to avoid detection when sneaking in luxury items like handbags and wallets at Singapore\'s land checkpoints. “I heard that some would remove the price tags and wear it on themselves to avoid detection,” he said. But Mr Cheng said he is aware of the S$150 tax relief limit and would remember to pay GST, adding that the recent case of a 25-year-old woman getting arrested for failing to declare branded handbags and accessories worth S$11,000 purchased overseas was fresh in his mind. “Cases like this are a reminder to declare. It’s just not worth breaking the law,” he added. “Especially if I’m bringing in goods in many bags, I would declare at customs and pay the tax. I am scared to get caught.” Mr Cheng added that shopping with his wife allows the tax relief limit for them as a couple to be S$300. \"My wife travels with me, so the chances of us exceeding (the combined tax relief limit of) S$300 for our items is low,\" he said. \'IT WILL BE ON MY CONSCIENCE\' Like Mr Cheng, food and beverage business developer Muhammad Syahid Bin Ismail told Channel NewsAsia that he would declare to custom officers, especially when buying large quantities of grocery items, as well as home furniture. “Sometimes we really had no choice to declare because the car was full of boxes. But we usually do no matter what. It will be on my conscience,” he said. Last year, Mr Syahid spent about RM2,200 (S$734) in total for lights and fans for his new home in Pasir Ris, which amounted to around S$51 in GST. “It’s still worth the hassle because we saved at least 50 per cent,” he said. WANT TO AVOID DELAYS? USE THE APP, CUSTOMS AND ICA SAY In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, Singapore Customs and ICA explained in a joint statement that to make the GST payment process \"seamless and hassle-free\", travellers may use the Customs @SG mobile app. (Source: Singapore Customs) \"The mobile app allows travellers to declare and pay duties and GST anywhere and anytime before they arrive at the checkpoints in Singapore,\" they said. \"Once tax payment is successful, the app will create an e-receipt in the travellers’ mobile devices and travellers may exit the checkpoints via the Green Channel,\" ICA and Singapore Customs added. \"If travellers are stopped for checks, they can show the e-receipts stored in their mobile devices as proof of payment to the officers.” The Singaporean shoppers Channel NewsAsia spoke to on Thursday were not aware that the app existed. Newlyweds Sharon and Paul Chia, who were doing their Chinese New Year shopping at Tebrau City, told Channel NewsAsia that knowing about the app would have saved them a lot of time. \"We brought back a plasma TV and sound system last month. We had to spend an hour queuing because of the massive jam during the holiday period,\" said Mrs Chia. After learning about the app, Mr Khalid said that he will consider using it. \"I guess this makes (paying for GST) easier. And if they (authorities) step up enforcement checks at the checkpoints, it\'s a good tool to have,\" he said.

Cases were reported in Punggol, Sengkang, Bukit Panjang, Woodlands, Hougang and Jurong West. Mr Bobin Thomas, his wife and two children woke up to the sound of floor tiles in their dining room \"exploding\" one by one in their flat at Block 638A Punggol Drive on Sunday (Jan 14) morning. Mr Thomas told Channel NewsAsia that when he and his wife saw the tiles start bending inwards, they immediately grabbed their children, a two-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy, and left the house. \"The tiles started bending inwards one by one (like there was) an invisible force. It was like something you see in the movies,\" said Mr Thomas. \"We called our children and got ourselves out of there,\" added the 35-year-old IT engineer.

(Photos: John Choo) As the family tried to navigate their way out, Mr Thomas said the tiles they stepped on wobbled and sank slightly. \"At the time, we thought that the building was about to collapse. It only became clear our unit was the only one affected when we saw that none of our neighbours were leaving,\" he said. It was only when the family was safely in a friend\'s unit at a nearby block did Mr Thomas, who is a tenant at the unit, call the owner of the flat to inform him of the situation. The owner later contacted HDB. According to Mr Thomas, a contractor later visited the unit and covered the affected tiles with cardboard. Cardboard was later placed by contractors on top of the tiles. (Photo: John Choo) The family will stay in a nearby apartment temporarily while their HDB flat undergoes repairs. \"It was just not possible for us to go back there. We have two kids and we don\'t know what might happen if the tiles explode again,\" he said. \"CRACKING SOUND\" Meanwhile, Mr Zul Effandy, who lives at Block 185, Jelebu Road at Bukit Panjang, told Channel NewsAsia that he and his wife were watching television at about 8pm when he suddenly heard a \"cracking sound\" from underneath the carpet in the living room. As the sound got louder, the pair jumped from their seats and backed away to safety, Mr Zul said. When the sound stopped, they pulled away the carpet to see that the tiles had \"exploded\". The tiles popped up at this flat in Jelebu Road, Bukit Panjang. (Photo: Zul Effendy) \"We are worried. I keep thinking it will happen again. I don\'t think we will get a good night\'s sleep tonight,\" he added. Mr Zul said that this is the first time the floor tiles have cracked since he moved in in 2000. In another case, Madam Ng Siew Hoon, a resident at Jurong West, said she was \"scared\" by what sounded like a \"loud explosion\" to her. \"Within five minutes, there was a loud explosion sound, like fireworks. Then all my floor (tiles) all cracked, from the door to the window. And the tiles in front of my toilet doors also. I was very scared and I called for help, called for my husband to come out and have a look,\" she told Channel NewsAsia. Mr Frederick Goh, who lives at Block 686C Woodlands Drive 73, said he heard cracking sounds in his flat just after midnight on Monday. The floor tiles cracked just after midnight on Monday at this HDB flat in Admiralty. (Photo: Frederick Goh) As of Monday morning, Mr Goh reported that the tiles in his home still seemed to be cracking \"once in a while\". He has reached out to HDB which has said it will send someone to inspect his unit. Mr Tan Chim Hoon, adviser at Singapore Renovation Contractors and Material Suppliers Association, said poor workmanship may be a possible cause of the cracks, and the recent chilly weather may be another reason. \"Now it\'s very cold or very hot. And there\'s a little bit of vibration. So this causes the tiles to have no place to expand. Because of this, the tiles all pop up,\" he said. In a Facebook post on Monday, HDB said should residents face such issues, they should carefully move the dislodged titles to a safe area and cover the affected area with cardboard. For advice on repair work, HDB added that homeowners can call its branch hotline at 1800-225-5432. HDB will then send someone to visit the affected flat and provide a list of contractors who can carry out the repair work. This story came from a reader tip-off.

But when the 39-year-old rushed out of the HDB unit to check, he saw a two-metre long tree branch pierced into his car\'s front windscreen. \"The windscreen was obviously damaged. The impact of the branch also caused a dent in the car\'s bonnet,\" Mr Toh told Channel NewsAsia. The lights inside the vehicle and his dashboard camera were also ruined by the incident. Mr Toh had parked his red Nissan Qashqai at an open-air car park near Block 6 Jalan Bukit Ho Swee to meet relatives. It was parked near a tall tree, which he estimated to be about 11-storey high. The branch fell from a height of about six storeys, he said. Advertisement Advertisement As Mr Toh assessed the damage on his car, he still considered himself to be \"very lucky\". \"If any members of my family was inside the car when the branch fell, it would have been disastrous,\" he said. Mr Toh called the authorities, and the Jalan Besar Town Council later sent an official to remove the tree branch. Channel NewsAsia has contacted the town council for comments. After the branch was removed, he sent his car to the workshop to repair the damage. \"I called my car agent who advised me to call my insurer but there was no one working as it\'s the weekend,\" he said. \"I hope it gets resolved soon.\" Earlier on Sunday, two cars parked along Margaret Drive were damaged after an eight-metre tall rain tree and a lamp post fell on them.

The 1.2 million sq ft building will include MCM Studio, touted as “the largest indoor theme park in Southeast Asia” and a shopping complex. Speaking on the sidelines of the theme park’s concept launch on Saturday evening, executive director for Capital World Siow Chien Fu told Channel NewsAsia that the mall, together with the theme park, will be fully ready by August. MCM Studio, which is also the fifth largest indoor theme park in the world, will take up the entire third and fourth levels of the mall. It will feature three main sections - Movie Planet, Cartoon Planet and Music Planet. Movie Planet will encompass thrilling rides such as Transformers, Dinosaur World and Haunted House while Cartoon Planet, which targets children, will showcase “kiddy attractions” such as Tom and Jerry as well as other animated characters. Advertisement Advertisement The attractions from both planets integrate “augmented reality and virtual reality” technology, MCM Studio said. “The rides are all customised for our visitors. They will be running away from dinosaurs and battling robots, all while in our new park,” Mr Siow said. Meanwhile, the park’s third section, Music Planet, will also showcase circus as well as musical and theatrical performances by “internationally renowned names” such as the Great British Circus. MCM said that there would be daily circus performances in a tent built within the theme park. “Outdoor circuses are not convenient, especially when the field where these tents are placed at are muddy. We want to make attending circuses a comfortable experience for all,” said Mr Siow. Besides the theme park, the mall also has three floors of retail, encompassing thematic zones. The zones will features elements from five different continents: America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Middle East. The Asian-themed zone in Capital City. (Photo: Capital 21 mall/ Facebook) For instance, the different floors have giant windmills, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and bright Japanese lanterns to indicate which zone they belong to. Capital City has not disclosed the name of the retailers at Capital 21 mall but Channel NewsAsia understands that 80 per cent of the retail space has been taken up. When asked how Capital 21 mall can stand out from recently mega shopping centres launched at Johor Baru such as IKEA and Paradigm Mall, Mr Siow maintained that entertainment is its comparative advantage. “We have to appeal to the modern shopper. With the rise of online shopping and e-commerce, we changed strategy many years ago. Our competitors mostly have one component - but we have many,\" he said. \"Our theme park is the major attraction for this project, supported by the shopping centre. The rest are purely shopping centres with similar retailers. What we have done is totally different,\" he said. Also in the pipeline within the same development are two hotels - Hilton Garden Inn and the theme park\'s very own Planet Hotel. The hotels will be built from the ground floor and Channel NewsAsia understands that they will open in 2019. Serviced apartments encompassing 690 units are also currently being built on towers on top of the current building. Despite nagging fears of oversupply in the real estate market in Johor Baru, Mr Siow stressed that he was confident that the apartments at Capital City will be occupied. “We only have 690 units and moreover, we are confident there is a demand in the Tampoi area,\" he said. \"There are many locals who would want to stay beside our mall and amenities,\" he said. Mr Siow added that there will be many staff working in the mall from overseas and they may stay at the serviced apartments too. The Capital City development is a 20-minute drive away from the Woodlands Causeway and Mr Siow added that he was confident it would appeal to Singaporeans. Capital City is 20 minutes from JB CIQ. (Photo: Capital 21 mall/Facebook) Mr Siow stressed that despite competition from Universal Studios Singapore, Singaporeans would still brave the jam and visit Capital City. \"We focus on nostalgic elements that many modern theme parks no longer have - like the circus. Singaporeans who still see the charm of the older type of theme park will visit Capital City. We are confident they will,\" he added.

IKEA Tebrau, which opened its doors last Thursday, is the Swedish company’s largest outlet in Southeast Asia. Although it is located just 16km from Woodlands Checkpoint, some Singaporeans who drove across the Causeway faced congestion lasting up to two hours on Sunday morning. The traffic jam at Woodlands Causeway was exacerbated by the first school holiday weekend for Singaporeans. “It’s not usually this bad,” said Mdm Fatimah Amin, who left her home at Tampines at 9am and reached IKEA Tebrau at noon. “I wanted to check out the new IKEA store, and perhaps buy some kitchenware. Jam or no jam I think you can\'t deny that the prices here are much cheaper than the stores in Singapore,\" added the 48-year-old school teacher. Advertisement Advertisement Mdm Fatimah purchased a Behagfull 24-piece kitchen cutlery set at RM139 (S$45). The same set costs S$55 at IKEA Singapore outlets. People queueing for food at IKEA Tebrau. (Photo: Amir Yusof) Many other Singaporeans Channel NewsAsia spoke to on Sunday shared similar sentiments as Mdm Fatimah. Engineer Mr Richard Hu said the currency difference made it \"inevitable\" that the goods at IKEA Tebrau would be cheaper than its Singapore outlets at Tampines and Alexandra. \"You can\'t deny the currency difference. Everything is cheaper, and if you buy in bulk, the amount you save adds up,\" he added. Channel NewsAsia compared the prices of several products on the catalogues of IKEA Singapore and IKEA Tebrau, and found that the goods sold at IKEA Tebrau were largely cheaper. The IKEA Malm bed, for example, is priced at RM969 (S$317) at the Tebrau outlet, compared with S$549 at the Singapore branches. This Malm bed is more than S$200 cheaper at IKEA Tebrau. (Photo: IKEA) Meanwhile, the Klasen barbeque set - comprising a charcoal barbeque pit and trolley - is priced at RM1,435 (S$469) at IKEA Tebrau, more than S$90 cheaper than IKEA Singapore. This 3-seat sofa set costs S$360 cheaper in JB. (Photo: Amir Yusof) A three-seat Landskrona sofa set, meanwhile, costs RM5,095 (S$1,660) at IKEA Tebrau, compared with S$2,019 at IKEA Tampines. PARKING WOES, PACKED RESTAURANT The potential savings IKEA\'s Tebrau outlet presented, however, came with some downsides for some Singaporean customers on Sunday. Many had to jostle with thousands of shoppers for parking space as well as a seat at IKEA’s cafe and restaurant. Cars parked illegally outside IKEA Tebrau. (Photo: Amir Yusof) By 11am on Sunday, IKEA\'s Tebrau\'s 1,771 parking bays were already fully occupied, and some customers resorted to parking illegally along the main road outside the store. \"I fully regret driving here,\" said Mr Hu, who had to drive his car up a kerb. \"We could have just taken a Grab here from the checkpoint. After all, we\'re just buying small items,\" he added. The 750 seats at IKEA\'s restaurants were also packed to the hilt from 11am-3pm, with some customers having to queue two hours for a seat. Large crowds queueing to enter the IKEA Tebrau restaurant. (Photo: Amir Yusof) “I haven’t had breakfast yet and it\'s already afternoon,” said Mr Hu, who queued for an hour before his family of four found a table. “But the meatballs and pasta here are so cheap - it would be a waste eating someplace else,” he said. On its launch day last Thursday, pictures of large crowds of people queuing outside the store went viral. But IKEA has clarified with Channel NewsAsia that the long queues were from people queuing to be the store\'s first 10,000 customers, in order to win a free goodie bag. \"LITTLE INCENTIVE FOR SINGAPOREANS TO CROSS BORDER\": IKEA Despite the difference in prices, an IKEA spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that the company sees \"little incentive\" for Singaporean customers to cross the border just to shop at the Tebrau outlet, due to taxes and transportation of bulky items. \"We believe that Singaporeans will still be more inclined to shop at IKEA Alexandra and IKEA Tampines due to the convenience and proximity,\" IKEA said. \"Customers would also need to keep in mind that delivery and assembly cannot be arranged from the Malaysia stores for Singapore addresses,\" it added. The entrance of IKEA Tebrau showroom at 10am on Sunday (Nov 19). (Photo: Amir Yusof) IKEA told Channel NewsAsia that cross-border delivery is not offered \"at the moment\" but highlighted that IKEA can deliver to \"any agency\" appointed by the customer, including delivery companies that provide cross-border services. Delivery costs from IKEA Tebrau to areas in Johor state range from RM80 to RM250 depending on distance. Mr Louis Tan, a Singaporean who owns a second property in Johor Baru, told Channel NewsAsia that shopping at IKEA Tebrau will benefit him as he can purchase items and have them delivered to his address in Malaysia. \"I\'m shopping for a kitchen cabinet and some items to refurbish my children\'s rooms for our home in JB. There\'s no way I can fit them into my car, so having them deliver and assemble is important,\" said the 54-year-old oil and gas executive. Mr Tan added that Singaporeans have to be practical when deciding whether to shop at IKEA Tebrau or the Singapore outlets. \"They have to do their math. Take into consideration everything - taxes at the Causeway, time stuck in the jam, petrol costs and the cost of bringing back the items,\" he said. \"They have to decide if it\'s worth it for them.\" Source: CNA/am Tagged Topics Shopping Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

They were on an escalator at Tanah Merah MRT station and at first, Military Expert 1 (ME1) Ong did not sense anything amiss. \"He was standing so close to her, I thought they were a couple. It was only after I walked passed them did I realise he was using his phone to take an upskirt video,\" ME1 Ong told Channel NewsAsia. He confronted the man and called the police who arrested the suspect. The police said they found upskirt videos on the mobile phone of the 18-year-old suspect. For his efforts, ME1 Ong was on Saturday (Nov 18) presented with a letter of appreciation from the police. “We would like to commend Mr Samuel for his quick-thinking and timely interception that led to this swift arrest,” said the police in a Facebook post. Advertisement Advertisement Said ME1 Ong: \"As a member of the SAF, I am trained and taught to do what is right and the right thing to do at that moment was to help the lady in need and not turn a blind eye.” \"I CONFRONTED HIM IMMEDIATELY\" Recounting what happened that morning, ME1 Ong, 25, said the girl did not realise what was happening. \"I confronted him (the suspect) immediately and he was shocked. The girl, who was listening to music did not realise what was going on until I tapped her on her shoulder and told her. She was shocked too,\" added the Republic of Singapore Navy weapons system operator on the RSS Endeavour. He then told the man he was going to call authorities and alerted SMRT staff when they got to the top of escalator. The man did not try to escape and apologised for his actions, said ME1 Ong. All three were then escorted by SMRT staff to a room. When the police arrived, the suspect was interrogated by officers. \"The man was subsequently arrested for public nuisance and will also be investigated for taking upskirt photos,\" police said. ME1 Ong told Channel NewsAsia that he was glad he stopped the suspect. \"After we reached the bottom of the escalator, I told the girl that we must not let this (matter) go. It was the right thing to do,\" he said.

The shop in Larkin Perdana has sparked controversy for pasting a notice on its front door saying that only Malaysian Malays were allowed to enter. The manager, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the reason non-Malaysians as well as ethnic Chinese and Indians were not allowed to participate was because they would not be able to understand the product demonstrations. “There will be a language barrier. If a non-Malay person sits in and watches our seminar, they won’t understand whats going on,” said the manager, who has been working for business owner Kyosei Marketing for a year. A sign outside Kyosei\'s Larkin Perdana store bars non-Malaysian Malays from attending its product demonstrations. (Photo: Amir Yusof) “We sell products like shoe soles to reduce pain in the feet, as well as vegetable juicers. And we want to explain to our visitors the right way to use them,” she added. Advertisement Advertisement The outlet conducts four sessions a day and locals who wish to attend the seminars are required to pay RM1 (S$0.32). They will then be given a welcome pack consisting of “Malaysian-made products” such as coffee powder and biscuits. When Channel NewsAsia visited the store on Friday afternoon, around 50 Malay customers were seated inside waiting for the demonstration to start. Meanwhile, two workers stood outside to collect payment for tickets and at the same time ensure that neither non-Malays nor non-Malaysians entered the premises. “We’ve had some Chinese locals trying to purchase a ticket, but we can’t let them in. We gave them info on some of our other outlets they can go to instead,” the manager said. Kyosei has various outlets across Malaysia in Ipoh, Johor and Kuala Lumpur. According to the manager, Chinese clients who are interested to attend Kyosei product seminars can go to a store in Kuala Lumpur, which is reserved for them. Customers can be seen waiting inside the Kyosei store in Johor Baru for a demonstration to begin. (Photo: Amir Yusof) “The demonstrations are done in Mandarin and they will be able to enjoy the whole experience. The products will be the same but the way they are presented will be different,” she said. Mr Abby Lee, a Malaysian Chinese who works at a hairdressing salon next to the store, said that he has tried to purchase a ticket to one of the seminars, but was stopped by the management. “They wouldn’t allow me in and told me to go to KL instead. Why would I go so far just to see what they have,” said Mr Lee, who is in his 50s. “The government says One Malaysia and all that, but these companies still discriminate. Of course I want to watch the seminars, you pay RM1 and get RM10 worth of free gifts. Who wouldn’t?” he added. However, Mr Tan Kok Yong, who owns a grocery store nearby, said that it was the company’s prerogative how it wants to conduct its business. “Its their business model and this is up to them. Its not that they don’t want to sell to us Chinese, they want to target certain racial groups at different stores. I have no problem with it,” he said.

(Photo: Amir Yusof) From outside the store, the demonstrations seemed lively, with loud music and audience engagement. The customers were clapping and cheering while a demonstrator standing on a small stage was encouraging them on to participate. Mr Ayob Sinin, who attended the event, told Channel NewsAsia that he does not mind if other ethnic groups join in, but he said they may feel “out of place”. “They were cracking jokes and making references that maybe not everyone can relate to,” he said. Kyosei Marketing, whose main office is located in Kuala Lumpur, declined to comment when contacted by Channel NewsAsia on Friday afternoon.

Flight MI351 was due to take off at 6pm, but as of 5.45pm it still had not landed at Penang. Mr Chen, who was in Penang for work, then had a bad feeling that the heavy rain that afternoon would significantly delay his trip home. \"As I was on my way to the airport from Gurney Plaza, half the wheel of my Grab car was submerged in water. I could see huge puddles of water everywhere and the rain poured continuously. The wind was so strong,\" said Mr Chen. The heavy rain that started as he made his way to the airport would continue throughout the night and into the next day, causing massive floods throughout the city. When airport staff announced at around 5.45pm that the SilkAir flight had been unable to land due to bad weather, passengers started to show discontent. Advertisement Advertisement \"Some were angry or worried. They raised questions with the ground staff on when the plane was going to arrive, and when they would be allowed to board,\" Mr Chen said. As things got heated, SilkAir ground staff then tried their best to calm down the passengers, assuring them that a solution would be found. \"They were so professional ... we were given frequent updates on the situation. At 7.45pm, 9.15pm and 11pm etc, even though we did not approach them, they would come to us and update us what was going on,\" Mr Chen said. Passengers were also given the option of staying at a hotel or taking a rescue flight, although passengers who chose to stay at a hotel had to turn around to the airport due to the flood. Other passengers opted to take connecting flights out of Penang to Kuala Lumpur. A SilkAir ground staff running to help bring passengers their new boarding passes. (Photo: Felix Chen/ Facebook) \"The SilkAir staff were particularly helpful here as they even ran to and fro the boarding passs printing area and the departure gate to make arrangements for the passengers,\" Mr Chen added. The remaining passengers, including Mr Chen, eventually boarded a replacement flight, MI9352 at 3am on Sunday, after waiting at the airport for nine hours. Mr Chen heaped praise on SilkAir ground staff in a Facebook post on Sunday. \"You guys handled it professionally and I’m sure it’s the best that you could have done during the time of uncertainty,\" he wrote. THREE FLIGHTS UNABLE TO LAND: PENANG AIRPORT Penang International Airport confirmed that three flights which were scheduled to land at Penang International Airport between 4.30pm and 6pm on Saturday were either forced to turn back to KLIA or diverted to Langkawi International Airport. “One flight from KLIA had to turn back while two others from KLIA and Singapore were diverted to Langkawi International Airport and have landed safely there,” said Penang International Airport senior manager Ramzi Ahmad. Mr Chen said that staff had informed passengers that MI351 was diverted to Langkawi. Mr Ramzi added that at least four flights from Penang Airport could not depart to their respective destinations due to the bad weather. He said that operations at airport were still running smoothly and so far, the airport has not been hit by floods despite heavy rain.

The treating physician, who wanted to be known as Dr Ahmad, attended to Mr Dominick Tan and Ms Clarice Lum Jie when they arrived at Pontian Hospital shortly after they had been rescued earlier in the day. Dr Ahmad said the pair told him they ate potato chips and nutrition bars while waiting for help. He also examined the pair for dehydration, broken bones and malnutrition, but found no symptoms. They were discharged between 2.00pm and 2.30pm on Thursday afternoon. Speaking to the media four hours after the duo were saved, a man who identified himself as Ms Lum’s uncle but declined to give his name said: “They were able to consume water from water bodies in the forest.” Another family representative, who identified himself as Mr Tan’s father but who also would not give his name, told reporters that the pair had brought only enough food for a half-day hiking trip.

Ms Lum’s uncle gave special thanks to Johor police chief Mohd Khalil Kader Mohd for approving the use of a helicopter to assist them with the search and rescue effort.

Mr Tan’s father added: ”Special thanks to the volunteers who came down without any form of personal (obligation).” He also paid tribute to the media for creating awareness of the fact his relative was lost, prompting many others to volunteer their time to help search for the duo. However when a reporter asked if the pair were a romantic couple, he retorted: “I think your question ... is not suitable. They are friends I can tell you that ... but I don\'t think we will entertain this type of question.” On how they went missing in the first place, Ms Lum’s uncle said: ”Why (were they) lost? Nobody knows. If you know the answer to that, please let me know.” Source: CNA/zl Tagged Topics Johor Gunung Pulai Malaysia Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Among households headed by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident which had at least one working person, the median monthly income grew 2 per cent in nominal terms to S$9,023 last year, from S$8,846 in 2016. Factoring in inflation, the increase was 1.5 per cent in real terms, data from the Department of Statistics showed.

Resident employed households across all income groups in Singapore also enjoyed real growth in average work earnings per member last year, the report said.

For 2017, the Gini coefficient - a measure of income inequality from 0 to 1, with 0 representing total income equality – remained near 2016 levels. It stood at 0.459 before taking into account Government transfers and taxes – little changed from 2016 and among the lowest in a decade. After taking into account Government transfers and taxes, Singapore’s Gini coefficient for 2017 was reduced from 0.459 to 0.401, unchanged from 2016.

The official data also showed that families staying in one-room and two-room HDB flats received more government transfers than those in other housing types. On average, resident households in one-room and two-room HDB flats received S$10,245 per household member from various Government schemes last year. This was more than double the average of S$4,433 received per household member across all housing types.

Instead, many market watchers have welcomed the pullback in the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) as a much-needed, healthy correction after hitting decade highs last month. Some have also described the sell-off as a buying opportunity, with OCBC’s analyst going as far as calling it the “Great Singapore Sale”. Singapore shares closed down 0.66 per cent, or 22.61 points, at 3,383.77 on Wednesday (Feb 7), reversing earlier gains as investors eyed a drop in the US stock futures. A day earlier, the local bourse posted its biggest one-day decline in two years, alongside a bloodbath in other Asian bourses spooked by a record-breaking fall in US stocks. Worries about elevated US Treasury bond yields and the likelihood of faster-than-expected US interest rate hikes had triggered panic selling on Wall Street last Friday, which deepened this week and extended into a global rout. Following months of near-ceaseless ascent, IG’s chief market strategist Chris Weston said global equity markets have “finally entered a period of increased volatility” which may be here to stay. But this week’s market upheaval may be less scary than it seems. Advertisement Advertisement Describing the ongoing sell-off as a “normal exchange of liquidity”, analysts from KGI Securities said the “rise in volatility should not warrant panic”. “Since February 2016, US stocks have led a bull run without a meaningful correction. In that sense, the market is surprised that such a pullback would take this long to occur.” While the so-called Vix \"fear\" index has risen, the CBOE Skew Index – an options gauge known as the “Black Swan” Index – remains down. This indicates “a perception that even though volatility is up, the risk of tail events remains low”, KGI analysts reasoned. Echoing similar sentiments, DBS analysts wrote in a Feb 6 report that recent market action “does not herald the start of a bear market” given that it is a “necessary consolidation” following months of stock market euphoria and the absence of a recession. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget “Taken together, the current market turmoil is similar to other mid-cycle corrections which have been seen in recent years.” “GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO RE-ENTER THE MARKET” Analysts also seemed sanguine about the outlook for local stocks. RHB Securities Research analyst Shekhar Jaiswal, for one, expects the benchmark index to remain on an uptrend this year though it is unlikely to repeat 2017’s handsome gains of 20 per cent. Citing the presence of supportive factors such as economic growth, the analyst still has a year-end target of 3,660 for the STI. “We have not seen any material changes in Singapore’s economic growth outlook. We believe this correction in STI Index offers an opportunity for investors to buy stocks at lower prices and at more reasonable valuations,” Mr Jaiswal told Channel NewsAsia. “We recommend investors to buy banking, consumer and selective real estate stocks.” Head of OCBC Investment Research Carmen Lee agreed, noting that the current correction is a “good opportunity to re-enter the market”. “With the across-the-board selling, quality stocks are now at more attractive level, especially for long-term investors looking to increase their exposure to blue chips,” said Ms Lee in her note titled \"Great Singapore Sale\", while referring to property and banking heavyweights such as UOL and DBS. Also urging investors to buy on the dip is CIMB analyst Lim Siew Khee, who had Venture Corporation, Genting Singapore and Keppel Corporation in a list of “must-own” stocks. \"No one knows how long the correction will last but we see the opportunity to prepare a shopping list of \'must-own\' stocks backed by fundamentals,\" she wrote in a note released on Wednesday. Still, market watchers agree that risk factors, such as stronger-than-expected inflation numbers in the US or even a deceleration in US economic growth, remain. Said Mr Oliver Jones, a markets economist at research firm Capital Economics: “We think that the US economy – which is currently in good health – will start to lose momentum late in 2018 or in 2019 as the boost from the fiscal stimulus fades and the effects of cumulative Fed tightening begin to bite.\" “We suspect that this would cause the US stock market to weaken further, and that this would result in another marked drop in emerging market equities.” Source: CNA/sk Tagged Topics Stocks Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

He added that it is important to “take action to prepare ourselves” and support the security agencies in keeping Singapore safe and secure. From S$14.8 billion in FY2011, Singapore\'s security spending has increased steadily to S$19.5 billion in FY2016, according to data from the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The latter accounted for 4.7 per cent of Singapore\'s gross domestic product (GDP) and makes up about 27 per cent of total government spending, official figures showed. When asked how much security spending could increase, Mr Heng declined to put a figure to it but noted that it is clearly an \"important area to invest resources in\". To fund these expenditure increases, it will be crucial for the Government to do its long-term projections for expenditure and revenue. More details will be revealed in the Budget statement on Feb 19, he added.

Over the past two years, specialist teams such as the Emergency Response Teams and the In-situ Reaction Teams have been deployed to respond swiftly and effectively to terror attacks. Meanwhile, the police have also leveraged technology to better support its frontline officers. One example is the increased use of analytics in operations, such as having police cameras equipped with video analytics capabilities to detect safety and security incidents. The police have installed more cameras in public areas to provide better sense-making capabilities during an attack, said AC How. More than 65,000 police cameras have been installed at 10,000 HDB blocks and multi-storey carparks as of Sep 2017. Another 11,000 cameras will be installed at 2,500 locations islandwide by 2020.

He’s been following us.” We had just walked past the junction of Geylang Lorong 22 and Guillemard Road when Sergeant Kamal Aziz alerted us. I turned to my right and was just in time to catch a glimpse as the man slipped into a sidewalk. Dressed in a black T-shirt and grey bermuda shorts, he was the person we did an identity check on just a while ago. The man had been behaving suspiciously. Earlier on, he turned around the minute he saw us approaching on Geylang Road. Though he managed to blend into the morning crowd and sneaked away, the policemen I was with spotted him at another side street soon after and decided to make a move. They found nothing on him but a quick check via a handy electronic device that the patrol officers carry with them showed the man’s previous offences in peddling contraband cigarettes. Advertisement Advertisement And now, he was tailing us on a bicycle as we continued our foot patrol. A GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE It was my first day with the Ground Response Force (GRF) officers from the Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC). One of the busiest NPCs in Singapore as I was told, its officers form the backbone of law and order in Geylang, industrial estates in Ubi and nearby residential areas, such as MacPherson.

(Photo: Hanidah Amin) GRF officers, or more commonly referred to as neighbourhood policemen, perform a wide range of duties from street patrolling to manning police counters and are usually the first responders to 999 calls. For my two-day attachment, which includes a 12-hour day shift and a night shift, I was assigned to follow Sgt Kamal and Sgt Shaun Goh. Our key task was to patrol the streets of Geylang. When we reached at around 8am, the area seemed relatively peaceful. Shophouses along Geylang Road were opening for business while ordinary folk got ready for the day. Nothing out of the ordinary, I thought. But according to the police officers, those working as “lookouts” for criminal activities such as illegal gambling and contraband cigarette peddling were already out and about. “It’s their body language and facial expressions. You can always tell if they have something to hide,” Sgt Goh told me, while keeping an eye on the surroundings and paying attention to his walkie-talkie. Foot patrol at Geylang. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) Years of on-the-ground patrolling had made both policemen skilled multi-taskers and what my untrained eye failed to pick up, they did. It also did not take me long to realise that effective patrolling required a thorough understanding of the area. While this could be achieved over time, “there’s no time to learn slowly” when it comes to Geylang, according to Sgt Goh. “The learning curve is steep,” he said, referring to each street in Geylang and its associated illegal activity. “You just have to pay attention to what everyone is doing and keep up.” And that I tried, as slowing the police officers down in times of emergency or during critical moments is the last thing I’d want to do. But there were times when I was left trying to catch up. Once, the officers made a dash across Lorong 12 and into a back alley after spotting a man on an e-bike whom they suspected was a “lookout”. I had been oblivious to the man who, according to the officers, had been trying to evade us whenever we were near. At a back alley in Geylang, police officers screen the identity of a man who was behaving suspiciously. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) A few hours later, I found myself sprinting across Geylang Road as the officers spotted another man for the same reason. This time round, the man was less cooperative. When asked for his identity documents, he pretended he did not have them with him and feigned ignorance for other questions. Later, he attempted to snatch his passport back from the police officers, prompting both officers to grab hold of his arms while issuing him stern warnings. Standing at just an arm’s length away from the man, my heart was pounding and I contemplated if I should take one step back. Despite these incidents, Sgt Kamal told me that Geylang is now “less chaotic” compared to when he first started patrolling the area five years ago, with a step-up in enforcement efforts over the years being the key reason. An inter-agency operations centre, which allows multiple government agencies to plan and execute operations, was set up at the Geylang NPC nearly two years ago. Since April 2016, \"multi-skilled enforcement teams\", comprising auxiliary police officers from various law enforcement agencies, have conducted \"high-visibility patrols\" at Geylang, according to Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam’s written reply to a parliamentary question on Jan 9 last year. Foot patrolling duties also covered car parks and crime-prone HDB blocks. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) The authorities have also tapped technology to enhance enforcement efforts at Geylang. More than 170 police cameras have been installed in the area since 2015 – a four-fold increase from 2014. Together with increased street lighting, these steps have helped to “enhance the deterrence and detection of illicit activities at back alleys and side lanes”, Mr Shanmugam said. Serious crimes reported in the area, including robbery and snatch theft, fell to 77 cases in 2016, a 42 per cent decline from the 134 cases in 2013. Public order-related cases, such as affray and serious hurt, also declined 27 per cent over the same period of time, said Mr Shanmugam, who stressed that more can be done to address other offences and social disamenities in Geylang. One of the most recent police operations in Geylang was the arrest of 19 men last month, which is probably why patrols in the area feel like an endless cat-and-mouse game. “Lookouts”, with their Bluetooth headsets, mobile phones and sometimes e-bikes, keep watch by taking strategic positions at coffee shops or entrances to specific side streets like Geylang Lorong 16, which is known for illegal gaming activities and peddling of contraband cigarettes. Some, like the man in black who was spotted by Sgt Kamal, follow police officers around though they usually stop after their covers are blown. But one thing was for sure: While we had our eyes on them, they too were watching us. INJURIES APLENTY Needless to say, Geylang is an area where people are not exactly the most compliant or respectful of police officers. As we did our foot patrol, every nook and corner seemed to have an injury-related memory for the officers in blue. For Sgt Kamal, a flight of stairs facing Geylang Road was where he and his partner were splashed with water and pushed to the ground by an accomplice of a man they found with a packet of heroin in his shoes. The man and his accomplice ran away but Sgt Kamal soon caught up with the man and wrestled him to the ground in the middle of Geylang Road before the officers arrested him. In another alley, an accused had tried to grab Sgt Kamal’s revolver when they were locked in a scuffle. Both incidents resulted in bruises and scratches for the 32-year-old. And when we passed by Lorong 25, both sergeants recalled an incident where a man splashed kerosene on another team of police officers from Geylang NPC. Desperately resisting arrest, the man was holding a cigarette and threatening to set the officers on fire. Foot patrol at Geylang. (Photo: Gaya Chandramohan) The sense of hostility towards policemen in Geylang also extends to verbal abuse as I found out during my overnight shift on day two. In one of the back alleys, we met one of the men we screened on the first day. Riding past me and towards the officers, he muttered “belah”, which means “go away” in Malay, before riding off quickly. The tauntings are common, said Sgt Kamal, who recalled being berated with racial slurs by a drunken man a few years ago. To be sure, this is not unique to Geylang. Across Singapore, cases of abuse against police officers have been on the rise, said Mr Shanmugam at a Home Team Academy awards ceremony last September. Noting a 65 per cent increase in physical and verbal attacks against officers from 2014 to 484 cases in 2016, the Home Affairs Minister noted that authorities have “zero tolerance” for such abuse cases. As such, his ministry has been working with the Attorney-General\'s Chambers to press for harsher sentences against those who prevent officers from carrying out their duties, Mr Shanmugam added. However, the harm caused by malignant words does not diminish when they are delivered via the Internet. The rising tide of vitriol online, such as those found in the comments section on websites and social media, can also have a demoralising impact. Said Sgt Goh: “Sometimes I feel especially affected when I go online and see in the (comments section), people bashing the police force for no reason at all. “Being human means you’ll have a strong urge to rebut these people but I guess so long as the Internet exists, everyone will have something to say. So despite feeling angry, I’ve learnt to just read and move on.\" RESPONDING TO 999 CALLS Our patrolling duties also extended to crime-prone HDB blocks and car parks. To my surprise, quite a number of drivers left valuables, such as CashCards or GPS devices, in open view when they leave their cars, making them vulnerable targets for theft. What the police officers would do in such instances is to note down the cars\' number plates and submit them to relevant authorities, which would then notify these drivers. Officers on patrol can retrieve information about people or vehicles easily via this electronic device. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) We were also dispatched to respond to 999 calls, which seemed to increase during the night shift. As messages about new cases came through, we found ourselves zipping to and fro Geylang and the other neighbourhoods. Cases we attended to range from incidents at the HDB estates, such as accidents, complaints of noise pollution and littering, to a dispute over a summon issued to a man for littering. Dozens of bottles of insect repellent found at an HDB staircase landing. (Photo: Gaya Chandramohan) During our night shift, we were also activated to serve as reinforcements for the arrest of a drug addict along Haig Road. The man, believed to be a repeated offender, was found with packets of heroin and was nabbed on the spot by plainclothes policemen. A man arrested for drug possession. (Photo: Gaya Chandramohan) Later on at around 2am, we were activated to a hotel in Geylang where a Singaporean man was arrested for dealing with contraband cigarettes. However, these calls could be false alarms sometimes. While patrolling, we were notified of an urgent call about a suspicious character spotted at Upper Boon Keng. But after rushing back to the police car, we were told that it was a nuisance call. This, unfortunately, is part and parcel of the police’s day-to-day work, said Sgt Kamal. According to figures from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the police received an average of about 1.3 million 999 calls annually between 2014 and 2016. This amounts to slightly more than 3,500 calls every day. In a written reply to a parliamentary question on Aug 1 last year, Mr Shanmugam noted that only about 40 per cent of these calls required direct police intervention and police resources were dispatched. The remaining calls were either nuisance calls or misdirected calls that did not require police attention, such as complaints about the cleanliness of common properties. Still, the officers stressed the need to treat each case, even the seemingly mundane calls, with importance given the unpredictable nature of their work. “Sometimes, when the case messages come through, you may not expect it to be a serious case but it could suddenly escalate,” said Sgt Goh. “You have to stay focused because there are certain decisions that you make at crucial moments that if you didn’t, will have greater repercussions.” We spoke to a resident who called for help after his neighbour fell and lost consciousness at home. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) LONG HOURS ON THE JOB While most parts of police work are unpredictable, one thing remains constant: The long hours on the job. A typical shift for an NPC officer is 12 hours long. This excludes team briefings before and after each shift, as well as preparation time for the loading of firearms and other necessary equipment. Police officers usually get assigned to a day and a night shift before being given two days off. On my first day, I arrived before dawn and knocked off at about 9pm. Needless to say, hours of foot patrolling and the need to maintain constant vigilance left me physically and mentally drained. The following day, it was another 14 hours on the job. Staying sharp through the gruelling wee hours of the overnight shift was particularly difficult for me but for the officers in blue, work goes on be it day or night. “You just learn to deal with it,” said Sgt Goh, recalling his first day at work nearly three years ago. “It was a day shift but I remember returning back to the station at close to 10pm. I was shocked that I ended work so late and it was only my first day.” Police officers attend briefings before and after each shift. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) And due to the long hours, sacrifices, such as quality time with loved ones, are inevitable. “My father had been sick but one day, he suddenly asked if I wanted to go out with him. I told him I couldn’t because I had to work,” recalled Sgt Kamal. “Three days after, he was admitted to the intensive care unit and passed away.” Since then, being able to return home to his family at the end of each work day is the biggest source of contentment for Sgt Kamal. Especially since his mother, who initially objected to his career choice, has relented and given him her blessings. “My mum wanted me to have an office job but I secretly signed up to be a police … She has accepted my work but I think she still hopes that I can be posted to another neighbourhood or department. “I always try to explain to her that if I do my job well, I’ll be safe. Otherwise, I’d just go home in long sleeves,” Sgt Kamal said with a laugh, referring to how he would wear long-sleeved shirts or pants to hide his bruises. Patrolling Geylang with Sgt Kamal Aziz and Sgt Shaun Goh. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) Other sources of job satisfaction can also be a simple “thank you” after an incident is resolved or a friendly “hi” from members of the public. Given the neighbourhood that they patrol day to day, it’s not difficult to understand why. While rare, Sgt Goh said he has met people, usually senior citizens, who asked if he’s had time for meals. “Bits of appreciation like these do make me feel a little better when I’m on duty.” This reminded me of an encounter on my first day. We were walking by a bus stop along Guillemard Road when a little boy sitting on one of the seats and accompanied by his parents shouted: “Hello police, how are you?” His voice filled with a tinge of excitement. Brows furrowed in concentration as he patrolled, Sgt Kamal’s face relaxed upon hearing that. To the beaming kid, he smiled and waved back: “Hello!” Source: CNA/sk Tagged Topics On The Job Police Geylang Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The floating production storage and offloading facility (FPSO) would be deployed for oil and gas production at Caratinga, a deep-water oil field located northeast of Rio de Janeiro. The contract, awarded by a Brazilian subsidiary of US engineering company KBR Inc, was a win for the young joint venture formed by Keppel FELS, which was later merged into Keppel O&M, and Brazil’s PEM Setal Group. Called the P-48, it was the “largest” FPSO conversion project undertaken in Brazil then and its delivery in 2004 marked a “milestone” for Keppel O&M’s operations in the South American country, said former CEO and chairman Choo Chiau Beng in a stakeholders report. There was, however, a darker side to the story. Between June 2001 and April 2002, Keppel O&M paid bribes in installments to Brazilian government officials who had helped “put pressure for the (P-48 project) to be carried out”, according to court documents released last month by the US Department of Justice (DOJ). Advertisement Advertisement Emails between Keppel O&M’s executives, a financial controller at its subsidiary and a joint venture partner contained instructions for money to be paid to “some governmental guy(s)”, and later referred to as “friends”, who said “it was definitely with their help that the conversion landed up in Brazil”. When the email authorising the last installment of US$50,000 was sent on April 4, 2002, a total of US$300,000 in corrupt payments had been made for the P-48 contract. That marked Keppel O&M’s first bribe-for-contract payment in Brazil and by 2014, the bribes had snowballed into US$55 million for the inking of another 12 deals with Brazilian state-owned Petrobras and Sete Brasil. As part of its modus operandi, millions of dollars in bribes were disguised as large commissions to a consultant in Brazil under legitimate consulting agreements. This consultant is believed to be Mr Zwi Skornicki, Keppel’s former agent in Brazil who was arrested in February 2016. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget These illicit payments, made to bank accounts in and out of the US under the names of shell companies controlled by Mr Skornicki, were then transferred to bank accounts elsewhere and into the pockets of company officials and politicians at the then-governing Workers\' Party in Brazil. For its dirty deal-making over 13 years, Keppel O&M, a unit of local conglomerate Keppel Corporation which state investment firm Temasek Holdings holds a 20.43 per cent stake in, was slapped with a hefty fine of US$422 million as part of a global resolution with authorities in three countries. This was a penalty harsher than the Keppel unit would have received under Singapore’s Prevention of Corruption Act, said Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law Indranee Rajah in Parliament this week. In response to the flurry of questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) during the first Parliament sitting of the year, Ms Indranee emphasised that Keppel O&M did not get off lightly for its involvement in the international corruption case. The Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) has also sought assistance for evidence from authorities in other jurisdictions for local investigations to move “as expeditiously as possible”. THE RISE OF WORLD’S LARGEST RIG BUILDER Headquartered in Singapore, Keppel O&M was incorporated in 2002 through the integration of offshore rig builder Keppel FELS, vessel repairer Keppel Shipyard and specialised shipbuilder Keppel Singmarine. The formation of the new Keppel unit was aimed at drawing the “synergies and collective strengths of its yards and offices worldwide”, and “end in-fighting and competing against each other”. \"To become a truly global company, we would have to forge a unified team,” Mr Choo was quoted as saying. And become a global player it did. Through acquisitions and partnerships with governments and businesses, Keppel O&M has since built up a network of 20 yards in the Asia Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, the Caspian Sea, the Middle East and the North Sea regions. It also has a stable of engineering and technology centres in countries, including Bulgaria and China. Keppel O&M has been the biggest cash cow of its parent company, typically contributing about two-thirds of group revenue, until recent years when plunging oil prices hammered profits at the world\'s largest rig builder. It operated at break-even profitability for the third quarter, while revenue for the three months to Sep 30 dropped 26 per cent to S$380 million on lesser work volumes and the deferment of projects. Keppel O&M also witnessed a change in leadership in 2017, with Mr Chris Ong taking over Mr Chow Yew Yuen as its chief executive. Prior to this, Mr Ong, 42, was the managing director of Keppel FELS. “STRONG NEXUS\" WITH BRAZIL The Keppel unit’s relationship with Brazil dates back to the 1980s when it took on various vessel repair and conversion jobs from Petrobras. In 2000, Keppel FELS formed a 60:40 joint venture with Brazil’s PEM Setal Group to grab a bigger slice of the Brazilian market. Within a year, FELS Setal secured US$120 million worth of contracts and began running its shipyard in Angra Dos Reis, said an April 2001 media release. The P-51 project, a semi-submersible production platform used in Petrobras’ Marlim Sul oil field, was one of the 13 deals that Keppel O&M won through the bribery scheme. (Photo: Keppel O&M) Its activities in Brazil expanded alongside the rise in the South American country’s profile as an important oil and gas (O&G) market, following the discovery of large oil reserves off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in the 2000s. Riding on this tide of growth in Brazil, Keppel O&M saw strong growth and along the way, began differentiating itself by moving up the value chain to produce higher-value customised rigs fit for harsh sea environments, industry experts told Channel NewsAsia. By 2012, the Keppel unit had delivered some 20 major projects, including floating production units (FPUs), drilling rigs, FPSO units and drillships in Brazil. According to IHS Markit\'s analyst Ang Dingli, Brazil accounted for the majority of Keppel O&M’s higher value projects. “Brazilian projects have definitely contributed much to Keppel’s order book given that each Brazilian project was typically of higher contract value than the smaller conversions that Keppel mostly secured in Asia,” he said. Underscoring Brazil’s status as one of its key markets, a 10-year anniversary supplement published in 2012 said the company is “anchored in Brazil” and has developed a “strong nexus” with the country. Even as Brazil’s O&G sector took a hit from a double whammy of political woes and plummeting oil prices, Keppel O&M said in its 2016 stakeholder report that the country “is expected to remain as an important oil and gas market in the long-term”. Apart from the country’s vast offshore oil and gas reserves, other positive factors include “significant funds for Exploration & Production (E&P) investments” from Petrobras and the intention of foreign oil majors, such as Shell, Total and Statoil, to increase their investments in Brazil. The Brazilian government also had flattering words for Keppel O&M. Speaking at the naming of the P-56 project, which was a US$1.2 billion contract clinched by a Keppel-led consortium to build a semi-submersible FPU for a Petrobras subsidiary, then-Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said: “We have proven that it is possible to build rigs, platforms and equipment for offshore exploration in Brazil.\" “We shall count on the partnership of companies which come from far away, such as that of Keppel FELS that comes from Singapore… They know that if they come to Brazil, they will have the guarantee of a demand from Petrobras,” she was quoted as saying in Keppel O&M’s 10-year anniversary supplement. Former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff (centre) seen at the naming of P-56 in June 2011 with Keppel O&M\'s top managers, such as former CEO Chow Yew Yuen (left). (Photo: 10th Anniversary Special Supplement in Upstream) But stiff competition for projects may have forced the company to find any edge possible to secure a deal. According to the US court documents, Keppel O&M made corrupt payments to obtain the 13 contracts even when concerns of running afoul with the law surfaced – as seen in the emails for the P-61 project. The US$1 billion contract, awarded in 2010 to an equal joint venture between Keppel FELS and US engineering firm J. Ray McDermott, involved the building and operating of the P-61 Tension Leg Wellhead Platform (TLWP) in the Papa-Terra field located in Brazil’s Campos Basin. Apart from being a boost in its order book, the project would help Keppel O&M to establish a \"stronger presence\" in a niche product area like the TLWP, said OCBC analyst Low Pei Han. Work to obtain the large platform construction contract from Petrobras began in 2007 but in March, a joint venture manager had expressed concerns about retaining Mr Skornicki for the project because “under the joint venture partner’s corporate governance rules it cannot pay (Consultant) to pay government officials”. An email from Keppel O&M’s executives in April said that if they are “so hand tied to the US Code of Business Conduct, it would not be possible to involve (Consultant) which in reality diminishes our chances in the project.” In 2008, following several discussions about limiting the scope of Mr Skornicki’s consulting services and bribery concerns expressed by the joint venture partner, an email from a Keppel O&M executive reiterated the need for “fees” to be made. “(Consultant) also mentioned that (the joint venture) was not originally invited for this project until much lobbying with his friends help. And the fees were told to us sometime ago. If they perceive us as not honouring our commitment, it may be bad for future business,\" DOJ’s documents showed. In 2009, executives from Keppel O&M authorised the payment of bribes equal to a percentage of the P-61’s contract value to a Brazilian official and the country’s then-ruling Workers’ Party. The illicit payment totalled US$8.8 million. A Keppel-J. Ray joint venture secured Brazil’s P-61 TLWP contract worth about US$1 billion in February 2010. (Photo: Keppel O&M) OVERHAUL OF CORPORATE CULTURE NEEDED Despite the high-profile corruption scandal, industry experts believe that Brazil remains a key market for Keppel O&M given the country’s abundance of deep-sea oil and gas reserves. Singaporean rig builders also remain best positioned to land upstream oil and gas contracts with their experience and expertise. But to avoid falling into the murky waters of corruption again, it will need a comprehensive revamp of the organisation, said Mr Toru Yoshikawa, professor of strategic management at the Singapore Management University’s (SMU) Lee Kong Chian School of Business. Citing how Keppel Shipyard was also charged with corruption more than 20 years ago, Prof. Yoshikawa noted that an overhaul of both the board and corporate culture will be necessary. “A change in people does not mean that this will never happen in the future so there needs to be a change in the system.” According to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), Keppel Shipyard was charged in 1997 for giving bribes to secure business deals overseas. For one, Prof. Yoshikawa raised the example of implementing a whistleblowing policy that would encourage and protect employees who speak up about malpractice in the company. These changes will also have to be extended to its subsidiaries overseas, he added. As part of its Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with US authorities, Keppel O&M has had to take on \"extensive remedial measures\". Those included disciplinary action against 17 former or current employees which led to seven employees departing the company; demotions and/or written warnings to seven employees; approximately US$8.9 million in financial sanctions on 12 former or current employees; and anti-corruption and compliance training for six employees. Keppel’s spokesperson said the company has “moved quickly” to strengthen its regulatory compliance measures and has rolled out an enhanced programme across the group. Specific measures include an enhanced code of conduct containing detailed anti-corruption provisions and guidance on dealing with intermediaries. Amid questions raised by corporate governance experts about the efficacy of its auditing and internal governance, the spokesperson responded to queries on Jan 5 that the current boards of directors of Keppel Corp and Keppel O&M “were not aware of the illegal payments” made in Brazil. The illegal payments were “deliberately concealed by those complicit in the bribery and structured as agency fees”. “The agency fees were not approved by the Boards of Keppel Corporation or KOM as they were built into the contract values of the respective projects and bidding for projects is in the ordinary course of KOM\'s business,\" the spokesperson added. While it is possible for the board to be unaware of the unclean deals, Prof. Yoshikawa suggested the set-up of an independent department within the company moving forward. This department will \"be neutral and free from any influence\" as it provides information about the company to board members. Such \"actionable\" plans will be crucial as Keppel O&M seeks to recover from the scandal, said the SMU professor. “Companies usually announce some commitment to make changes following such incidents, but people will be watching at how actionable and implementable these plans are.” Source: CNA/sk Tagged Topics Keppel Crime Corruption Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Ms Indranee was responding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) about the international bribery scandal that has engulfed the rig-building unit of local conglomerate Keppel Corp. For giving bribes of more than US$50 million over 13 years to officials in Brazil in exchange for business deals, Keppel O&M has been slapped with a staggering US$422 million (S$567 million) fine as part of a global resolution with authorities in three countries. Court documents released by the US Justice Department on Dec 23 said that the company \"knowingly and wilfully conspired” to pay bribes between 2001 to 2014 to win business deals with Brazilian oil firms Petrobas and Sete Brasil. Given that the case involved several Brazil-based projects dating back to 2001, many evidences, including documents and witnesses, are located in different jurisdictions. According to Ms Indranee, the AGC will need these evidence for its investigations and has sought assistance from foreign authorities. Advertisement Advertisement “AGC has asked for certain information from them and some of its requests are still pending. AGC anticipates that further requests will have to be made as the investigations develop.” The AGC is also working on a request for mutual legal assistance, revealed Ms Indranee. This is a procedure whereby one country formally seeks assistance from another to obtain or secure evidence for use in its own investigations and proceedings. How quickly and to what extent these requests will be processed depend on the courts of the jurisdictions in which these requests are made, said Ms Indranee. “Obviously the intention is to move as expeditiously as possible. However, as I have explained, not all aspects of the investigation are within our control,” she said, while adding that this is an “international case” involving several foreign investigating agencies. “Only after the investigations are completed can the AGC properly assess the case and decide on the appropriate response. This is something for the Public Prosecutor to decide, independently.” Investigations into individuals involved in the graft scandal are ongoing. Ms Indranee noted that local investigations were conducted on the same timeframe as the US and Brazilian investigations and date back to 2001 when the corrupt acts first took place. While there is no agreement within the United States\' Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) that prevents the disclosure of individuals under investigation, it is “standard practice” in Singapore and many other jurisdictions to not identify individuals under criminal investigation. “Individuals will be identified if and when charges are preferred in court.” \"ROBUST\" GLOBAL RESOLUTION Authorities in the US, Singapore and Brazil had worked together to \"reach an agreed approach\" for Keppel O&M\'s case, Ms Indranee said. “There was no \'three-nation plea bargain agreement\',” she said in response to a parliamentary question from Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim. “What happened was that each jurisdiction acted under its own domestic laws, but in coordination with the other two jurisdictions.” As part of the global resolution, Keppel O&M entered into a DPA with the US Department of Justice. Under which, it has to pay about US$105.6 million to the US. Brazil will receive US$211.1 million or 50 per cent of the total criminal penalty. Singapore will receive US$105.6 million or 25 per cent, according to US court documents. In Singapore, Keppel O&M has committed to certain undertakings and will pay to the Government US$52.7 million within 90 days from the date of the conditional warning. Another sum of US$52.7 million must be paid within three years from the date of the conditional warning, less any penalties paid to Brazilian authorities during this period. Keppel O&M also struck a leniency agreement with Brazil’s Federal Public Ministry. In Singapore, the public prosecutor directed the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) to administer a conditional warning on Keppel O&M. Factors considered for this decision include how Keppel O&M had voluntarily reported its internal findings to the CPIB and AGC in September 2016 and cooperated with all 3 jurisdictions in the investigation and resolution process. A conditional warning allows Singapore to impose conditions that are \"closely aligned\" with the terms of the DPA, said Ms Indranee. This \"aligned approach\" allows for a \"robust resolution\" to the case, she added. \"The trilateral resolution requires Keppel O&M to pay a total of US$422 million. If Keppel O&M fails to pay the penalty, there will be consequences under US, Singapore and Brazilian law.\" \"Any penalty or claim that Keppel O&M might be subject to under Singapore law would be far less than what the company is now liable for under the coordinated resolution.\" Given that Keppel O&M is also required to strengthen its internal controls, compliance and anti-corruption programmes under the DPA, Ms Indranee said the current resolution has achieved more than what could be done if the matter was proceeded solely on the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). AUTHORITIES WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT COMPANY IS A GLC Citing the 2014 corruption bust at Singapore Technologies Marine (ST Marine), Ms Indranee said that as long as there is “good reason to investigate, the authorities will do so whether or not the company is a government-linked company”. For the case of ST Marine, at least S$24.9 million in bribes were falsely claimed as entertainment expenses and made to employees of ST Marine\'s customers in return for ship repair contracts. Seven former ST Marine executives were convicted last year for their part in the graft scandal. In response to the parliamentary question from Aljunied GRC MP Pritam Singh about the role of the Government and Temasek Holdings in overseeing the conduct of GLCs oversees, Ms Indranee explained that the Government does not interfere in nor influence the business decisions or operations of Temasek and its portfolio companies. Likewise, Temasek does not interfere in the business decisions or operations of its portfolio companies. “These are the responsibilities of the respective companies’ boards and managements,\" Ms Indranee said. “Temasek holds the boards of its portfolio companies responsible for running the companies honestly and competently. If the boards do not perform, Temasek can, collectively with other shareholders, change the board,\" she added. State investment firm Temasek Holdings holds a 20.43 per cent stake in Keppel as of Aug 15, 2017. EXPECT LOCAL FIRMS TO UPHOLD INTEGRITY STANDARDS WHILE OVERSEAS Ms Indranee emphasised that Singapore does not condone or tolerate corruption. While local firms will have to operate in varied kinds of environments overseas, they will have to do so \"while keeping their systems clean\" as well as complying fully with the laws of Singapore and the countries they operate in. The Government \"cannot be a global policeman”, said Ms Indranee. Therefore, Singapore companies operating overseas will have to uphold their own standards of integrity. \"Singapore companies have to operate in all kinds of environments. But as a matter of principle, we expect that they must do so while keeping their systems clean, and complying with the laws of the countries where they operate.\" \"They must develop ways of operating which enable them to do this. They cannot lower their own standards of integrity, and they must not bring back to Singapore practices alien to the norms which we have established with such great effort here.\" Ms Indranee said: \"Incorruptibility is a foundational value for Singapore. We must keep Singapore clean.\" Source: CNA/sk Tagged Topics Keppel Crime Corruption Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The settlement, reached with criminal authorities in the United States, Brazil and Singapore, is unprecedented for a local company. So is the penalty, totalling US$422 million (S$567 million), which is believed to be a record involving a Singapore-listed entity. The corrupt payments of US$55 million made between 2001 and 2014 also surpassed the bribes unearthed in a corruption bust at shipbuilder Singapore Technologies Marine (ST Marine) in 2014. Then, at least S$24.9 million in bribes were falsely claimed as entertainment expenses and made to employees of ST Marine\'s customers in return for ship repair contracts. Seven former ST Marine executives were convicted last year for their part in the graft scandal. The latest bribery scandal involving Keppel O&M, a unit of conglomerate Keppel Corporation, has raised questions about its corporate governance and caused turbulence, albeit temporarily, in the shares of mainboard-listed Keppel. State investment firm Temasek Holdings holds a 20.43 per cent stake in Keppel as of Aug 15, 2017. Advertisement Advertisement WHAT HAPPENED: According to court documents released by the US Justice Department, Keppel O&M \"knowingly and willfully conspired” to pay bribes as part of a “decade-long scheme” to win 13 contracts with Petrobas and Sete Brasil. These two Brazilian oil companies have been embroiled in a sprawling graft probe dubbed “Operation Car Wash” carried out by the country’s federal police since 2014. From 2001 to around 2014, millions of dollars in bribes were disguised as large commissions to a consultant in Brazil under legitimate consulting agreements. These illicit payments, made to bank accounts in and out of the US under the names of shell companies controlled by the consultant, were then transferred to bank accounts elsewhere and into the pockets of Petrobras officials and politicians at the then-governing Workers\' Party in Brazil. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget From the 13 contracts that it secured through the 13-year-long bribery scheme, Keppel O&M and its related entities earned US$351.8 million. WHO\'S INVOLVED: The consultant, who played the key intermediary role in this bribery scheme, was not named in the US court documents but is believed to be Mr Zwi Skornicki, Keppel’s former agent in Brazil from 2000 to 2016. Mr Skornicki was arrested in February 2016 as part of a fresh wave of searches and arrests under “Operation Car Wash”. He was nabbed after former Petrobras executive Pedro Jose Barusco Filho made the allegations against him in his testimony to Brazilian police as part of a plea bargain in November 2014. US court records also pointed out the involvement of six former executives at Keppel O&M, with four of them being Singapore citizens. One of the remaining executives is a legal permanent resident of the US, while the other holds US citizenship. The executives are unnamed in the US court documents. An August 2016 report by Bloomberg, which referred to Mr Skornicki’s Jul 21 testimony in court, named five top managers at Keppel and its marine and offshore units who allegedly knew about and authorised his bribe-for-contract payments in Brazil. They include former CEOs of Keppel O&M Chow Yew Yuen and Tong Chong Heong, former CEOs of Keppel FELS Brasil Tay Kim Hock and Kwok Kai Choong, as well as former Keppel CEO Choo Chiau Beng. Mr Choo was also Singapore\'s non-resident ambassador to Brazil from 2004 to 2016. The Keppel executive, who is a US citizen, is believed to be Mr Jeffery Chow – a senior member at Keppel O&M’s legal team from 1990 to 2017. The 59-year-old admitted to drafting contracts for bribe payments and has pleaded guilty on Aug 29, according to US court documents. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 2, 2018. Bribe recipients were two Brazilian officials who worked at Petrobras between 2003 and 2012, and one party official who held a senior position in Brazil\'s Workers\' Party. According to Mr Skornicki’s testimony, the party official is believed to be Mr Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of Brazil’s Workers’ Party. He has been sentenced to 15 years and four months in jail for corruption and money laundering in September 2015. THE PROJECTS: The bribery scheme landed Keppel O&M with 13 contracts from Petrobras and Sete Brasil. Here are the details of each: 1. The P-48 Project Around 2001, Keppel O&M, through a joint venture, won a subcontract to convert a floating platform for Petrobras. From around June 2001 to April 2002, bribe payments of US$300,000 were made to government officials in Brazil with “instructions and authorisation” from Keppel O&M’s executives, according to court documents. 2. The P-51 and P-52 Projects In 2003, the consultant received authorisation from Keppel O&M executives and the firm’s joint venture partner to pay bribes equal to a percentage of the contracts\' value. That added up to about US$13.3 million. The consultant made the illicit payments through an intermediary to a Brazilian official at Petrobras, who kept some of the money for himself and shared the rest with another company official and Brazil\'s Workers\' Party. 3. The P-56 Project Around 2007, the consultant learned from a Brazilian official that Keppel O&M and its joint venture partner would need to pay bribes in an amount equal to a percentage of the contract value to obtain the P-56 project which resulted in about US$14.2 million in bribes. The money went to a Brazilian official and the Workers\' party. In the same year, the consultant received authorisation to pay the bribes, which was approximately US$14.2 million. 4. The P-53 and P-58 Projects In 2005 and 2009, executives of Keppel O&M and a Keppel O&M subsidiary in Singapore authorised the consultant to pay bribes equal to a percentage of the contract value of both projects to a Brazilian official and the Workers\' Party. The bribes paid to secure portions of two floating platform hull conversion projects from Petrobras, was approximately US$4.4 million. 5. The P-61 Project Around 2007, Keppel O&M and Keppel O&M USA, as part of a joint venture with an engineering company, began work to obtain a large platform construction contract from Petrobras. In 2009, the consultant received authorisation from a Keppel O&M executive and an executive at Keppel O&M’s Brazil subsidiary to pay bribes equal to a percentage of the project\'s contract value to a Brazilian official and the Workers\' Party. The sum was about US$8.8 million. 6. The Sete Brasil Projects Between 2011 and 2012, Sete Brasil contracted with five companies to commission the construction of a fleet of ultra-deepwater rigs for which Petrobras would be the end user. The construction contracts were split among the companies, with a Keppel O&M subsidiary successfully bidding for contracts for construction of six semi-submersible units. Court documents showed that participating companies, including Keppel O&M, negotiated bribes with a Brazilian official equal to 0.9 per cent to one per cent of the value of their respective contracts. Two-thirds of the payments were designated to the Workers\' Party and one-third was to be divided equally between the relevant Petrobras and Sete Brasil executives. During the negotiation period, Keppel O&M executives authorised the consultant during several telephone calls to pay one per cent of the contract value as bribes. Accordingly, the consultant received approximately US$14.4 million in bribes to the Brazilian officials and the Workers\' Party. WHAT KEPPEL DID: Keppel was first cited in the “Operation Car Wash” investigation in February 2015 when Brazilian media reported claims that Keppel FELS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Keppel O&M, and Sembcorp Marine’s shipyard in Brazil had made bribe payments to Petrobras directors and the Workers\' Party in Brazil. Both companies refuted the allegations then. When court testimonies from Mr Skornicki emerged in July 2016 with allegations of Keppel’s involvement in illegal payments made by him, the Singapore conglomerate denied the allegations and reiterated its “zero-tolerance stance against any form of illegal activity” in a filing to the Singapore Exchange on Jul 24. Later in August 2016, Keppel denied the Bloomberg report that bribe payments were done with the approval and endorsement of its senior management. It said: “None of the individuals named in the article, including the current CEO of Keppel Offshore and Marine Mr Chow Yew Yuen, have ever authorised Mr Skornicki to make any payments as bribes.” Only in October 2016 did it announce that it recognise \"certain transactions\" associated with the company\'s former agent in Brazil \"may be suspicious\" following internal investigations. It also notified authorities in the relevant jurisdictions of its intention to cooperate. Following the disclosure last month, Keppel Corp chairman Dr Lee Boon Yang said the company was \"deeply disappointed\" by the incident, adding that \"global companies such as Keppel have both a legal and moral duty to operate fully within international laws and regulations\". \"Since the allegations emerged, we have moved quickly and decisively to put in place stricter controls and embedded best practices across the group to ensure that such unacceptable behaviour will not be repeated,\" Dr Lee added. Keppel Corp CEO Loh Chin Hua also said that \"effective compliance controls are now thoroughly embedded\" across its businesses, \"supported by rigorous anti-corruption training and robust compliance and governance regimes\". US court documents said Keppel O&M has taken on \"extensive remedial measures\" as part of the deferred prosecution agreement. Those included disciplinary action against 17 former or current employees which led to seven employees departing the company; demotions and/or written warnings to seven employees; approximately US$8.9 million in financial sanctions on 12 former or current employees; and anti-corruption and compliance training for six employees. A Keppel spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that the company has \"separated with all the executives defined as ‘relevant individuals’ in the Statements of Facts released by the authorities.” Disciplinary action has been taken against employees involved in the misconduct, including separation and financial penalties, added the spokesperson. But the company is unable to \"comment on any individual employee, or the specific penalties imposed against individuals\" for legal reasons. When asked about the guilty plea by former lawyer Jeffery Chow, Keppel\'s spokesperson mentioned deep disappointment in the behaviour uncovered. \"It is not how Keppel conducts business. We have taken robust steps to strengthen controls and compliance to ensure that such unacceptable behaviour is not repeated,\" the emailed response added. Amid questions raised by corporate governance experts about the efficacy of its auditing and internal governance, the spokesperson responded to queries on Jan 5 that the current boards of directors of Keppel Corp and Keppel O&M “were not aware of the illegal payments” made in Brazil. The illegal payments were “deliberately concealed by those complicit in the bribery and structured as agency fees”. “The agency fees were not approved by the Boards of Keppel Corporation or KOM as they were built into the contract values of the respective projects and bidding for projects is in the ordinary course of KOM\'s business,\" the spokesperson added. Keppel also revealed that it began its internal inquiry led by external counsel when allegations first surfaced in 2015. The denials by Keppel then, and in July as well as August 2016, were issued after taking into consideration the relevant evidence available at that time. “As the inquiry continued and suspicious transactions in Brazil were uncovered, Keppel promptly announced in October 2016 that it had notified the authorities in the relevant jurisdictions and offered to cooperate fully and extensively in the investigations. Keppel also encouraged all its employees to cooperate fully with the authorities,” the spokesperson added. WHAT\'S NEXT: In Singapore, Keppel O&M has accepted a conditional warning from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). This was issued in lieu of prosecution for corruption offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act and part of the global resolution, said the Dec 23 joint statement from the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) and the CPIB. The local authorities said that in issuing the conditional warning in lieu of prosecution, \"due consideration was given to the substantial cooperation\" rendered by Keppel O&M to the investigations - which included the unit\'s self-reporting to AGC and CPIB of the corrupt payments made by it - and the \"extensive remedial measures taken\". \"Investigations in respect of the individuals involved are ongoing,\" the statement added. Meanwhile, Singapore’s Workers\' Party (WP) has filed questions related to the bribery scandal for the Parliament sitting on Jan 8. Members of Parliament Pritam Singh, Sylvia Lim and Png Eng Huat have collectively tabled four questions to seek details about the global resolution that Keppel O&M reached with authorities, the investigations being carried out by local authorities, as well as answers about the role of the finance ministry and Temasek Holdings in overseeing the conduct of government-linked companies (GLCs) overseas.

Keppel Offshore & Marine (Keppel O&M) disclosed on Dec 23 that it would pay a hefty penalty of US$422 million (S$567 million) as part of a global resolution with authorities in three countries to resolve bribery charges. According to court documents released by the US Justice Department, the offshore and marine arm of Keppel Corp \"knowingly and wilfully conspired” to pay bribes to Brazilian officials and politicians in exchange for business deals. The illicit payments, amounting to US$55 million made between 2001 to 2014, helped Keppel O&M to secure 13 contracts from Brazilian oil firms Petrobas and Sete Brasil. The bribes were disguised as large commissions to a consultant in Brazil, who in turn made payments to people who had influence over the deal-making. Following the shocking disclosure, Keppel’s stock took a hit when markets reopened after the Christmas break. Shares of the conglomerate on Dec 26 sank as much as 5 per cent before clawing back losses to close 2.4 per cent lower at S$7.29. Advertisement Advertisement But the counter managed to regain its footing after that and has managed to retrace lost ground to end the first trading week of 2018 at levels higher than where it was before the sell-off. Keppel shares ended Friday (Jan 5) at S$7.77, compared to its closing level of S$7.47 on Dec 22. Market watchers mostly described the post-Christmas sell-off as a knee-jerk reaction as investors grappled with the news. Moving forward, while some of the market’s attention will fall on the release of Keppel’s full-year earnings at the end of the month, investors may have “left it all behind in 2017”, said KGI Securities Singapore analyst Joel Ng. Echoing that sentiment, CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang said the staggering fines, while shocking, would be mere “short-term pain”. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget The optimism stems from analysts’ expectations that the financial impact from the scandal would be negligible. Keppel in its Dec 23 statement said it will make a provision for the fines in the current financial year, which it described as an “extraordinary item” that would have a “one-off” impact on the group’s earnings. The penalty would account for about 4.5 per cent of Keppel\'s third quarter net asset value and the conglomerate would have financial resources to pay the penalty, noted OCBC analyst Low Pei Han. The company’s recent divestments of its stakes in the Keppel Cove and Nantong projects in China will also help to offset the fines, added Mr Ng. The analyst from KGI Securities has maintained his \"buy\" call on the stock. “I think the impact of the fines is largely manageable. Investors will generally be looking at Keppel’s growth going forward in 2018 and 2019.” Nomura analyst Abhishek Nigam said that while the staggering fine is “undoubtedly a negative from a financial standpoint”, it will likely have a minimal impact on Keppel’s operations in Brazil or its ability to bid for future contracts. In fact, the resolution could be seen clearing up much of the uncertainty and “removing a key overhang” on Keppel, added Mr Nigam who also has a “buy” call on the stock. Also helping to brighten the outlook include factors such as improving fundamentals in the offshore and marine sector (O&M) on the back of rebounding oil prices and expectations for Keppel’s property business, which constitutes its key earnings driver, to hold up. Mr Ng said: “In the long run, the property business will remain the major contributor to earnings but even on the O&M side, the sector is picking up. We are starting to see capital expenditure coming back and more projects being rolled out.” “We are confident that the management will be able to deliver on the growth plans,” he added. REPUTATION, CREDIBILITY TAKEN A HIT: EXPERTS But corporate governance experts that Channel NewsAsia spoke to are less sanguine. Given how the corrupt payments were undetected over a protracted period, the saga highlights serious questions about the efficacy of the company’s auditing and internal governance, said Associate Professor Lawrence Loh, director at the Centre for Governance for Institutions and Organisations at the NUS Business School. “The bribes themselves are naturally an area of critical concern. But what is more disturbing is the extremely long period that these have been happening without being detected.\" Assoc Prof Loh noted that the “substantive nature and monetary quantum of the contracts” that facilitated the bribes would have thrown up red flags. “The current debacle thus presents a most urgent call for the company’s governance to get to the root of the matter,” he added. Bribery allegations involving Keppel O&M first emerged in February 2015 when Brazilian media reported claims that Keppel FELS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Keppel O&M, and Sembcorp Marine’s shipyard in Brazil had made bribe payments to Petrobras directors and the Workers\' Party in Brazil. Both companies refuted the allegations then. After this, Keppel repeatedly refuted the allegations until October 2016 when it announced that it recognised \"certain transactions\" associated with the company\'s former agent in Brazil \"may be suspicious\" following internal investigations. When asked about its previous denials, a Keppel spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that it began its internal inquiry led by external counsel when allegations first surfaced in 2015. The denials by Keppel then, and in July as well as August 2016, were issued after taking into consideration the relevant evidence available at that time. “As the inquiry continued and suspicious transactions in Brazil were uncovered, Keppel promptly announced in October 2016 that it had notified the authorities in the relevant jurisdictions and offered to cooperate fully and extensively in the investigations. Keppel also encouraged all its employees to cooperate fully with the authorities,” the spokesperson added. But Mr Toru Yoshikawa, Professor of strategic management at the Singapore Management University’s (SMU) Lee Kong Chian School of Business, said the saga has raised doubts over the “firm’s credibility and also about its executives’ attitudes towards corporate ethics i.e. denying any wrongdoing until it is exposed with evidence”. “It is natural that executives in charge react strongly and try to deny any wrongdoing when they are being accused. But it is critical for executives and the board to step back, conduct internal investigation, and report their finding to the public as soon as possible, which they did not do this time,” he added. Echoing that sentiment, Assoc Prof Loh said that while Keppel’s early reactions were based on information available then, they have now “backfired” with the subsequent developments. “The initial denial thus further added to the damage that has been now inflicted,” he said. Corporate governance experts said the scandal has caused a dent in Keppel’s reputation and remedying it would hinge on how the firm responds to the public scrutiny. “There is definitely a dent on its reputation, but it is not a shipwreck,” said Assoc Prof Loh. “With the resolution and resolve, it should demonstrate visibly that there are proper policies and procedures in place and in force.” Keppel’s spokesperson said the company has “moved quickly” to strengthen its regulatory compliance measures and has rolled out an enhanced programme across the group. Specific measures include an enhanced code of conduct containing detailed anti-corruption provisions and guidance on dealing with intermediaries.

The local currency was last seen trading at 1.3301 per US dollar, gaining more than 0.4 per cent to touch its highest level since May 2015. Apart from a retreat in the US dollar, latest growth data depicting a firm outlook for the Singapore economy added to the “positive spin” in the currency on the first trading day of 2018, said National Australia Bank\'s head of markets strategy and research for Asia Christy Tan. Advance estimates released at the market open showed the Singapore economy expanded 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, beating the median forecast of 2.7 per cent in a Reuters poll. “Apart from the fourth quarter GDP release that came in quite strong, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s comments over the weekend about growth reaching the top end of the official target also provided positive spin to the start of the year,” Ms Tan said. In his New Year message on Sunday, Mr Lee said the economy was ending 2017 stronger than it started, with economic growth for the year at 3.5 per cent. Advertisement Advertisement This full-year GDP estimate hits the upper limit of the Government’s revised growth forecast range of 3.0 to 3.5 per cent, and shows the economy picking up pace from 2 per cent growth in 2016. Even though the fourth quarter GDP figure was a pullback from the previous quarter as growth in the manufacturing sector eased, economists, such as DBS\' Irvin Seah, were upbeat that a broadening out in recovery could see the services sector “take over from the manufacturing sector as the main engine of growth in 2018\". This continued to fan expectations that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) may tighten monetary policy by strengthening the Sing dollar as early as April. “We think there\'s a chance that they may tighten to a slight appreciation bias in April,” said Maybank Kim Eng Research’s economist Chua Hak Bin. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget “The Sing dollar is already close to the top side of the policy band and there are signs that inflation could come in higher than what MAS is anticipating,\" he added. ASIAN CURRENCIES SET FOR FURTHER GAINS IN 2018? The Sing dollar was not the only Asian currency to gain ground on Tuesday, as the US dollar languished near a three-month low. Elsewhere in the region, the Taiwan dollar was the biggest percentage gainer, rising 0.8 per cent against the dollar to a more than four-year high. The South Korean won also soared to a more than three-year high against the US dollar, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday he was open to dialogue with the South. The Chinese yuan was also firmer and hit a near four-month high against the greenback. Market watchers that Channel NewsAsia spoke to believe that Asian currencies could continue their uptrend against the greenback this year, though gains may be tempered following a robust 2017. For one, central banks in Asia are leaning towards tighter monetary policy, with the Bank of Korea becoming the first to do so last November after raising its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2011. “For the past two years when the Fed hiked rates, Asia did not take any action but we expect that to change this year. This will help some of the Asian currencies to gain a little bit more against the US dollar even after a strong 2017,” said ANZ’s senior strategist Irene Cheung. “The global environment also remains constructive for Asia in terms of exports and we think the export rebound could have more room to go in 2018,” she added, noting that the Sing dollar, South Korean won, Thai baht and the Taiwan dollar are among those poised to strengthen against the US dollar. Meanwhile, the outlook for the greenback remains “pretty mixed” despite the US Federal Reserve looking set to raise interest rates three times this year, according to National Australia Bank\'s Ms Tan. “We still expect monetary tightening in the US but that’s data-driven. Inflation will have to show some form of support and markets will need to see some deliverables from US president Donald Trump’s economic policies,\" she said. \"The base case is for the US dollar to recover somewhat but we belong to the camp that the recovery could be delayed with the reforms getting waylaid somewhat.\" Source: CNA/sk Tagged Topics Singapore SGD Economy Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The flash estimates showed the trade-reliant economy expanded 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, easing from growth of 5.4 per cent in the previous quarter but beating expectations of 2.7 per cent in a Reuters poll. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the gross domestic product (GDP) for the October to December period also expanded at a slower pace of 2.8 per cent, compared to the 9.4 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Economists surveyed by Reuters had a median forecast of 2.9 per cent. The manufacturing sector remained the brightest spot in the economy with an expansion of 6.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. This, however, was a moderation from the 19.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, the sector shrank by 11.5 per cent after surging 38 per cent during the July-September period. Services producing industries, which account for two-thirds of the economy, expanded by 3 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year ago on the back of growth in the finance and insurance, wholesale and retail trade, as well as transportation and storage sectors. Advertisement Advertisement But this was a slight slowdown from the 3.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the services sector expanded at a seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 7.5 per cent, faster than the 3.4 per cent growth in the third quarter. The construction sector remained the laggard with a contraction of 8.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, extending the 7.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter. The contraction was largely due to the weakness in private sector construction activities. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, the sector shrank by 3.6 per cent, easing from the 5.5 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget ANOTHER POSITIVE YEAR AHEAD? Singapore\'s trade-reliant economy has staged a remarkable turnaround in 2017, thanks largely to improving global demand for electronics products. With the manufacturing sector in the driving seat, the economy clocked its quickest year-on-year expansion in nearly four years in the third quarter. But economists have said that the sector will likely see a growth moderation due to a comparison against a high base recorded since the fourth quarter of 2016 – the quarter which the manufacturing industry began its turnaround. This moderation in factory activity will likely continue in 2018 but economists, such as Maybank Kim Eng Research’s Chua Hak Bin, do not think it will be a cause for concern. “I don\'t think we can expect manufacturing to keep running at the double-digit pace that we’ve seen. It will come down to single digits but it will remain a respectable number.” Moving forward, the services and construction sectors will likely “contribute to a greater proportion of growth as manufacturing wanes”, added Dr Chua. “Growth has broadened out, especially in services in the second half of 2017, and some of that momentum will strengthen further this year,\" he said. UOB economist Francis Tan expects the battered construction industry to return to modest growth in 2018, following six consecutive quarters of contraction. “Construction will become better in 2018 (and) we may finally see positive growth for the first time though a small one in the third quarter,” he said, citing the boost from the bringing forward of S$1.4 billion worth of public sector contracts and a revival in the local property market. For 2018, both economists have an optimistic outlook on the economy though GDP growth may cool off slightly. Dr Chua expects full-year growth to be 2.8 per cent, while Mr Tan has a forecast of 2.5 per cent given potential headwinds, such as a slowdown in China’s economy. MTI said last month that it expects the Singapore economy to grow by 1.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2018. In his New Year message on Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the economy was ending 2017 stronger than it started, with economic growth for the year at 3.5 per cent. This full-year GDP estimate hits the upper limit of the Government’s revised growth forecast range of 3.0 to 3.5 per cent, and shows the economy picking up pace from 2 per cent growth in 2016. Wages have also gone up across the board, especially for low- and middle-income earners, said Mr Lee. The advance estimates released on Tuesday take into account data in the first two months of the quarter. MTI will release the GDP figures for the fourth quarter and the whole of 2017 in its Economic Survey of Singapore next month.

He said this in the first formal update since chairing a taskforce to look into high prices of formula milk that came into the spotlight in March last year. The price of formula milk catering to babies up to six months old has dropped 13 per cent. Formula milk for those aged six to 12 months is 9 per cent lower, and for children aged one to three years, has fallen 5 per cent. Dr Koh was referring to Nielsen retail data, which looked at average formula milk prices in November last year in comparison to prices in May. A survey last year showed that that the average price of a 900g tin of infant milk powder in Singapore had soared 120 per cent over the last decade to more than S$50. The Government then set up a taskforce to look into tightening regulations on labelling and advertising, facilitating imports of more formula milk options, strengthening public education, and encouraging good practices in hospitals. Advertisement Advertisement MORE AFFORDABLE FORMULA MILK OPTIONS In May last year, Dr Koh said in Parliament that the Government is working to make more formula milk options available. On Thursday, he said there are now five affordable brand options costing less than S$35 for infants aged below 12 months, up from two in May last year. He added that the Food Regulation will be amended to help curb excessive marketing and allow better competition on price instead of on health or nutrition claims. The amendments will prohibit health claims, nutrition claims, texts and messages that idealise the use of infant formula, and mandate a statement on the superiority of breastfeeding. For example, he said that claims of formula milk having calcium and iron will be forbidden as such nutrients are ubiquitous across brands. INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS IN NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN Surveys conducted by the Health Promotion Board showed that between July and September last year, there was an increase in the proportion of mothers who intended to switch from formula to whole cow\'s milk, from 43 per cent to 62 per cent . The proportion of mothers who are aware of the appropriate age to introduce solids to their child also increased from 49 per cent to 71 per cent. The proportion of the respondents who are aware that all formula milk in Singapore contains sufficient nutrition for their baby also increased about 10 percentage points. The increase in awareness has translated to tangible shifts in consumers’ purchasing patterns of formula milk, Dr Koh said. Between May and November last year, the total sales of formula milk decreased by about 17 per cent.

Even though this area is seen as a popular and straightforward trekking destination, Dominick Tan and Clarice Lum Jie were not rescued until Thursday. So how can you avoid getting into difficulties when trekking overseas? Channel NewsAsia spoke to experienced trekker Vijay Kumar, founder of SG Trek, to get some safety tips. 1) KEEP OTHERS INFORMED OF YOUR PLANS Before you embark on your trek, inform family and friends of the exact location of your trail. Also register with the local authority before starting your hike. 2) KNOWLEDGE IS POWER Advertisement Advertisement Take note of which which trail you are taking, its length and how long it will take to complete. Estimate what time you expect to complete the trek and what time you expect to return home - and then share this information. Note all exit points of the trail carefully, and make sure that you are armed with emergency rescue contacts. 3) EQUIP YOURSELF WITH BASIC ESSENTIALS Daypack Food Sufficient water Survival knife Compass/GPS system/map Headlamp Spare batteries/power banks First aid Whistle/emergency blanket Rain jacket/extra set of warm clothing 4) KEEP CALM IF YOU GET LOST If things go wrong, don\'t panic. Rely on your supplies. Check the map to see if you can figure out how far you are from the original trail. If you can, get back to the trail and stay there and wait for other trekkers. 5) INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LOCATION WILL HELP RESCUERS If you are too far away from the trail, try to get to a high vantage point to observe your surroundings. Also try to find the coordinates of your location and check your surroundings to note landmarks. When you call for emergency rescue, give a description of the location as accurately as possible. Do not move from this location.

He was responding to Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol Zainal Sapari, who asked whether the ministry is willing to reconsider the names of merged schools to manage \"ground sensitivities\". \"We should let the schools focus on their teaching and learning programmes to benefit their students,\" Dr Puthucheary said. MOE announced the names of the four merged schools last month. Senior Minister of State for Education Janil Puthucheary in Parliament. He said that the three options when choosing a name are retaining one of the two names, coming up with a new name and combining names. He said that in the combining of names, the ministry ensures the name is meaningful, and that it is not repetitive. The factors that go into the decision include the age profile of the students, the history and heritage of the schools and stakeholders\' interests, he added. He also said that similar factors go into naming primary and secondary schools as well as JCs. In the case of the recent JC mergers, he said stakeholders including the students, alumni and parents were engaged in the process of deciding the name. School leaders engaged stakeholders on key elements of the merger including programmes and values to be retained and names, he added. \"On balance, a decision was made to have a combined name to allow the merging JCs to move forward as a combined entity,\" he said. He was responding to Mr Zainal’s questions on why there is inconsistency in the approach adopted in finding an appropriate school name for different educational levels and whether the respective schools\' stakeholders, including alumni, staff, parents and pupils, are engaged in the process of naming the merged schools. MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol Zainal Sapari in Parliament. Mr Zainal also asked what support is being given to the affected merged JCs alumni associations to help them retain the history of their schools. Dr Puthucheary said that there will be a “localised” and a personal effort by the schools in the development of materials for this purpose. \"We will work with both schools, both sets of alumni to try to find some way of commemorating the heritage and history of both schools,\" he added.

Under the Cybersecurity Bill, owners of computer systems directly involved in the provision of essential services for national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order will have to report cybersecurity incidents related to these systems, and comply with other statutory obligations . The owners of these systems - called Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) - have to comply with codes of practice and standards of performance, conduct cybersecurity audits and risk assessments, and participate in cybersecurity exercises under the Bill. No action will be taken against CII owners for cybersecurity breaches if they comply with their obligations, Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim said during the second reading of the Bill on Monday (Feb 5). However, non-compliance will be an offence that will entail a maximum penalty of S$100,000, two years in jail, or both, he said. The Bill also authorises the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incident. The chief executive of the CSA will be appointed as the Commissioner of Cybersecurity to administer the Bill. The Bill allows the Commissioner to designate as a CII any computer or computer system that is necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service. Advertisement Advertisement LICENSING FRAMEWORK FOR TWO SERVICES The Bill also prescribes a licensing framework, which will apply to providers of two types of cybersecurity services- penetration testing and managed security operations centre monitoring. “These providers have access to sensitive information from their clients, and the services are also relatively mainstream in our market, and hence have a significant impact on the overall cybersecurity landscape,” Dr Yaacob said. The requirement will not apply to in-house work, and providing licensable services to related companies, he said. Failure to get a licence for a licensable service will mean a maximum penalty of S$50,000 fine, two years in jail, or both. For a start, the licensing framework will be “light-touch” as this is a new initiative and there is a need to strike a good balance between industry development and cybersecurity needs, Dr Yaacob said. In explaining the need for legislation in cybersecurity, Dr Yaacob pointed to a debilitating impact on the economy and society caused by cyber-attacks in other countries. Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim in Parliament. He gave the example of how the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) had to cancel at least 6,900 appointments due to the “WannaCry” ransomware attack., and how the hacking of power grids in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, led to power disruptions that affected more than 200,000 citizens during winter. MPs RAISE QUESTIONS ON PRIVACY, COST OF COMPLIANCE MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC Saktiandi Supaat said some people hold reservations that the authorities, while conducting their investigations, would intrude on personal privacy. He asked if there are there safeguards in place for the broad investigation powers to ensure that there is no misuse in authority, whether unintentional or not. MP for Aljunied GRC Pritam Singh noted that the Bill gives the Commissioner and any authorized officer the power to take, remove or make copies of a hard disk, even if it is only to assess the impact or potential impact of a cybersecurity threat. He asked what qualifies as an incident major enough for such powers to be exercised “so that the House is assured the Commissioner\'s powers will be used very judiciously and not against government critics and individuals”. Responding to similar questions by several MPs, Dr Yaacob said: “Let me assure the House that the powers under the Bill are not intended to intrude into privacy,” adding that the measures and requirements are mainly technical, operational or procedural in nature. For example, CII owners may be required to implement network perimeter defence devices such as firewalls, or to perform regular vulnerability scanning of their systems to identify potential loopholes. These measures are non-intrusive with respect to personal privacy, he said. MP for West Coast GRC in Parliament. MPs also asked about costs that will be incurred by companies implementing cybersecurity measures. MP for West Coast GRC Patrick Tay asked if there any measures in place to ensure that the cost of compliance with CII requirements do not trickle down extensively to the consumer. Dr Yaacob said that many owners of CIIs have put in place cybersecurity measures arising from regulations within their sectors. There will be cost implications for some CII owners who will have to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of their computer systems to meet the requirements of the Bill, Dr Yaacob said. However, while the Government will work with sector regulators to streamline the cybersecurity audit and incident reporting processes in order to harmonise cybersecurity requirements under the Bill in the respective sectors wherever possible, no funding will be provided, he said. “If organisations follow good security-by-design practices, they will spend less overall in the long-run to fix cybersecurity issues,” he said.

He was responding to a question from Workers’ Party Member of Parliament (MP) Pritam Singh in parliament on Monday (Feb 5). Referring to such incidents outside of Speakers\' Corner, Mr Singh asked how the police exercises its discretion in requiring some calls for signatures for the purposes of a petition to go ahead without a permit, while requiring a permit in other instances. Mr Amrin added that when a permit is or is not required is “clearly set out in the provisions”, and that the police will “generally act on information received and conduct investigations before deciding what actions to take”. Mr Singh also asked whether the police will “favourably consider” an application to collect signatures for the purposes of a parliamentary petition on any given matter in a public place. Workers\' Party MP Pritam Singh in Parliament. He asked how and at which public venues other than Speakers\' Corner citizens legally make arrangements to sign such a petition. Mr Singh added that a parliamentary petition requires a physical signature. Mr Amrin, said that those who wish to hold such events outside the Speakers\' Corner will have to apply for a permit. He asked that Mr Singh file a separate parliamentary question if there are particular incidents \"so we can look deeply into the issue and give a comprehensive response\".

Responding to recommendations by the ElderShield review committee on Tuesday (Jan 30), they told Channel NewsAsia that the current payout of S$300 or S$400 may be too little. Health economist from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Dr Phua Kai Hong said that the payouts may have to be raised to cover at least half of the average monthly cost of providing intermediate or long-term care, which could come up to more than S$1,000. He added that eligibility for the payouts has to be better defined. Currently, payouts are given to those who cannot independently perform at least three of six activities of daily living - washing, dressing, feeding, toileting, moving around or transferring oneself from a bed to a chair. The standard is used by the approved private insurers which offer such disability insurance schemes. He called the criteria \"over-simplified\" compared to case management in other countries like Japan that use more complex matrices that account for factors like changes in severity of disabilities and level of social and financial support. A director with online financial adviser InsureDIY, Lim Shujun, said that she hopes the enhancements will include better coverage and benefits. Advertisement Advertisement “The feedback has consistently been that the benefits are too low in terms of both payout and duration,” she said. Echoing the sentiment, executive director of the Disabled People’s Association Dr Marissa Lee Medjeral-Mills said there needs to be further study into whether the current payouts will be enough to help with the kind of assistance people with severe disabilities require. In an attempt to make the scheme universal, the committee recommended that those with pre-existing severe disabilities be included among future policyholders. This is not the case currently. Giving an interim update on Tuesday, the review committee’s chairman Chaly Mah said that premiums will \"probably\" increase. He added that the committee is reviewing payouts, which are pegged to premiums and the payout period. Currently, S$300 monthly payouts are given for a maximum of five years, while S$400 payouts, for up to six years, depending on when policyholders joined the scheme. The full set of recommendations are expected by the middle of this year. The enhancements to the scheme, if implemented, will apply to those aged 40 and below when it takes effect. RECOMMENDATION FOR COMPULSORY ELDERSHIELD BENEFICIAL Among the recommendations by the committee was that an opt-out component should be scrapped. Associate Professor Angelique Chan, executive director of the Centre for Ageing Research and Education (Care) at the Duke-NUS Medical School said the suggestion to make the scheme mandatory is good because people often underestimate the probability of becoming disabled. “After age 60, a woman can expect to live 26 more years but eight of these will be in a disabled state. For men, after age 60, they can expect to live 22 more years with three of these years in a disabled state,” she said. Prof Chan, whose research interests are ageing and health, added that the more educated are likely to live longer than the less educated and thus “we project a growing population of disabled as our population gets more educated”. Dr Phua also said he agreed with the scheme being made compulsory to prevent practices like \"cream-skimming\" by insurers. This refers to choosing patients for characteristics other than their need for care, which improves the profitability or reputation of the provider. It often means choosing less ill patients. “When then there is a choice to opt out, those who are likely to need the insurance the most, the poor elderly, are likely to opt out. Those who can afford to contribute to the risk-pooling and those who can afford alternative financing, are also likely to opt out,” he said. In response to the committee\'s recommendations that the Government take over as a single administrator of the scheme instead of the current three private insurers, Dr Phua said long-term care is a societal problem that the Government can best fix. “Long-term care is not completely insurable by the private insurance industry, as the risks and costs are not predictable with an increasingly ageing population, and they are profit-driven,” he said. STARTING ELDERSHIELD EARLIER The committee also suggested that enrolment into the scheme start at age 30 instead of 40, in order to ensure the scheme is affordable. “It helps us spread the premium over a longer period, it helps younger people start to think about caring for the time when they start to get older,” Mr Mah said. Ms Valerie Toh, 31, an office manager thought an enrolment age of 35 was more manageable, as people tend to be more financially secure then. But Ms Kavitha Meyappan, 30, a civil servant agreed with the recommendation. “We aim to be an inclusive society so that’s good. As long as it can be paid through Medisave, I am okay with pooling the money for the future,” she said.

The lowering of the age limit will ensure premiums for the severe disability insurance scheme are more affordable, as policyholders start contributions to the scheme earlier, the committee said in its first formal update since 2016. “We think that it\'s important for citizens and permanent residents (PRs) to start thinking about long-term care and disability, start the coverage early,\" said the committee’s chairman Chaly Mah, adding that such risks are \"under-appreciated\". It is important for them to start thinking about setting aside money for old age, he said, pointing to statistics showing that one in two Singaporeans who are healthy at the age of 65 is at risk of having a severe disability during their lifetime. The recommendations for enhanced Eldershield coverage, if implemented, will only apply to cohorts who are aged 40 years old or below when the scheme takes effect, the committee said. All Singaporeans and PRs with Medisave accounts are automatically enrolled in ElderShield at the age of 40, unless they opt out of the scheme. Advertisement Advertisement ElderShield helps policyholders who cannot independently perform at least three of six activities of daily living - washing, dressing, feeding, toileting, moving around and transferring oneself from a bed to a chair for example - with monthly payouts of S$300 or S$400 a month, depending on when they joined the scheme. Currently, a person who joins ElderShield 400 – the default plan for people who joined ElderShield after September 2007 – at age 40 pays S$175 (male) and S$218 (female) a year, until they reach age 65. The maximum premium payment age is age 65. Mr Mah said the committee is looking at the structure of the premiums, and the amount paid out, which is pegged to the premium. Premiums will \"probably\" increase, he said. The committee recommended that those aged between 31 and 40 should be included in the enhanced coverage. The recommended scheme would also not allow opting out, as opposed to the current scheme, he said. Currently, 5 per cent of each cohort opts out, the committee said. In his National Day Rally speech in 2016, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the Ministry of Health would look into enhancing the ElderShield scheme to better address the needs of Singaporeans who become disabled during their old age. ADMINISTRATION BY THE GOVERNMENT Currently, those covered by the scheme are under private insurers Aviva, Great Eastern or NTUC Income, assigned at random. They have an option to switch providers upon enrolment. The committee recommended that the Government be the single administrator, to allow for greater flexibility in subsidising premiums and in future scheme enhancements. Chairman of the government administration sub-committee Chan Chia Lin said that government administration would simplify the process. The thinking behind having private insurers administer the scheme was to leverage their insurance. Open tenders were put out and a competitive bidding process allowed the Government to select the best value, she said. The committee, however, received feedback that the scheme should be run in a not-for-profit manner. A “UNIVERSAL AND INCLUSIVE SCHEME” The committee recommended that ElderShield be made a scheme that covers everyone in future cohorts, including those with pre-existing severe disabilities. Under the current scheme, those with severe disabilities are not included. “Universal coverage will provide assurance for the lower-income who may find it challenging to save for their long-term care needs,” the committee said. The committee also suggested some improvements to the claims process, such as training frontline staff or social workers to help policyholders and their caregivers access ElderShield, and expanding the current 140-strong pool of assessors. Chairman of ElderShield claims assessment sub-committee Loh Yik Hin said that currently, when claims need to be made, those insured and their caregivers do not know which insurer they are covered by and what their coverage is. “This heightens the stress of patient and caregiver and we want to tackle this,” he said. Senior Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that he welcomed the committee’s interim recommendations. \"The enhanced ElderShield will enable Singaporeans to pool our risks and resources in preparation for old age, when one faces higher risks of becoming severely disabled. It is an important pillar of Singapore’s social safety net as our society ages,\" he wrote. \"The Government will look at providing premiums subsidies to keep the premiums affordable for lower and middle-income Singaporeans. This reflects our values in building an inclusive society, where we help and care for one another,\" he added. The committee’s full recommendations are expected to be ready by the middle of this year.

Under the Healthcare Services Bill that will be tabled later this year, emergency ambulance services which cater to patients with acute or sudden medical conditions requiring emergency care will have to fulfill different requirements from medical transport services which cater to more stable patients. Emergency ambulance services, for example, will need to employ a clinical director who will be accountable for the maintenance of high standards in providing comprehensive emergency care. The clinical director will be expected to conduct an audit, as well as training and protocol development. Vehicles used for medical transport services will not be allowed to be fitted with blinkers and sirens. And this, the private ambulance operators said could potentially pose a problem for them. File photo of an ambulance parked outside the accident and emergency department of a hospital. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) Advertisement Advertisement Operations supervisor at First Ambulance Khai Mazlan said that patients\' conditions could deteriorate en-route and may need immediate medical attention at the nearest hospital, although under the new classification, her ambulances would be grouped under medical transport services. She said: \"Once there was a patient who was bleeding in the ambulance, his blood pressure started to drop and we needed to rush him to the nearest hospital.\" The firm serves more than 30 patients a day and works with the National Kidney Foundation. Director of Comfort Ambulance & Services Eugene Yang, who has been in the industry for 15 years echoed this view. \"Sometimes, the cases we take could be non-emergency in nature. But patients\' conditions could deteriorate, and they could be upgraded to (an) emergency,\" he said, adding that not being able to use sirens or lights in such situations would pose a problem. His firm serves more than 50 patients a day and has tie-ups with five hospitals. In order to solve the predicament, the firms have decided to invest to convert their medical transport service vehicles into emergency ambulances, which are able to provide both services. Mr Yang said he will be investing at least S$200,000 to convert his 26 vehicles into emergency ambulances. He will also upgrade the GPS systems in the ambulances, he said, adding that the cost will inevitably reflect in fees. \"We private ambulance operators are sandwiched. I think medical transport services would be a suitable classification for those ambulances in nursing homes. We are a hybrid,\" he said. Dr Charles Johnson, who manages Hope Ambulance, and plans to register his fleet of 42 ambulances for emergency services, however, has no issues with the classification. His firm conveys about 100 patients a day. \"It\'s a logical move. The needs are different for each category of patients. Patient safety could be compromised if medical transport services attend to emergency cases,\" he said. OPERATORS WELCOME REGULATION DESPITE CONCERNS While he considered the classification problematic, Mr Yang acknowledged it would have its merits. “This will up the level of competition. The public can be assured that there will be high standards, with a medically-trained professional being accountable,” he said. It will also weed out mushrooming small companies who may not provide proper training, he added. Major operators who spoke to Channel NewsAsia said that regulation of the industry has been a long time coming. Currently, the operators are governed by guidelines provided by the Health Ministry (MOH) almost 20 years ago, which are not enforceable. “I think it’s (the regulation) long overdue. Ambulances are an extension of healthcare, and we need to ensure that standards are in place, that ambulances are properly equipped. Prior to this, the standards have been too basic, there was no policing,” said Dr Johnson. He added that standards will rise as operators risk their licence if they do not comply. An SCDF emergency ambulance. (File Photo: TODAY) MOH said it recognises that providers may require support to ramp up capabilities, and will help to facilitate the ramp-up process by introducing a Voluntary Accreditation Scheme. The Scheme will encourage ambulance operators to comply with requirements early and work with educational providers to develop ambulance crew training programmes in order to upgrade their personnel, a spokesperson said. Dr Johnson said that the legislation could be tightened, by including details on how the ambulance should be built, as several ambulances are modified cargo vans. “When that happens, walls are not reinforced, floor is not reinforced. Ambulances are in harm’s way every single time. We need to build safe vehicles that will protect their occupants,” he said. MOH said based on 2017 data, the existing Singapore Civil Defence Force fleet of 60 ambulances service an estimated 90 per cent of the emergency cases conveyed to public sector hospitals.

She said this involves not only the government, but voluntary welfare organisations, charity institutions and the ordinary man in the street. She was speaking to the media after a tour of social services agency AWWA’s health and senior care programmes and facilities in Ang Mo Kio. “Not all of them need critical care, but all of them need interaction, social support, activities and that takes place within the community,” she said. She added the Government will be taking lessons from Community Networks for Seniors, a pilot programme announced in the 2016 Budget speech. The programme is aimed at enhancing integration and pooling of resources for elderly-related services. She pointed to the rapidly ageing population for the focus in the upcoming Budget, as the number of citizens aged 65 and above is expected to increase from 450,000 in 2015 to nearly one million in 2030. Advertisement Advertisement Efforts have been ramped up over the years to provide for the ageing population. From 2011 to 2017, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has more than doubled home care and day care places. MOH also previously said that it targets to build 10 active ageing hubs in new public housing developments. When asked what is expected of the community in supporting seniors, Ms Indranee said there is a trend for people here wanting to volunteer and to contribute. She noted that AWWA has 12,000-strong pool of volunteers made up of individuals and corporates. “What you do is try not to tax one person or one organisation all the time. You spread it out, and people have enough goodwill,” she said.

These measures, which include the relocation of a control panel that gives staff quicker access to activate pumps manually, will be put in place at Lavender, Redhill, Kembangan and Expo MRT stations. Giving the media a behind-the-scenes look at the changes at Bishan MRT station early on Wednesday (Jan 24) morning, rail operator SMRT showed how the panel had been moved from an area that required access to the track to a restricted area at an end of the train platform. SMRT’s director of buildings and services Siu Yow Wee said that this would mean quicker action in the event that the automated pumping system does not work. These pumps direct rainwater to street-level drains. Previously, the control panel was located in an area which required track access. (Photo: Ruyi Wong) At its old location, during operational hours, it typically took staff at least 20 minutes to get to the control panel, as staff would need to gear up, gain track access and take a train to the area. Train services would also be disrupted. With the change in location, track access is no longer needed. Advertisement Advertisement “Anytime we see that there\'s a problem or some alert, or we think the pump is not working, we can just send a station manager to the buffer area to press the button,” he said. The buffer area lies between the track and the train station. In addition, easier access to the water pumping system at Bishan MRT station through a ladder is in the works, said Mr Siu, explaining that of all the water pumping systems, Bishan\'s handles the largest capacity of water – enough to fill up two Olympic-sized pools. Redundant float switches, which activate pumps automatically, will also be installed at the four other locations so that if one fails, additional float switches can ensure that pumps are activated when needed. Flood prevention works at Bishan MRT station, which included the relocation of the panel, installation of additional float switches, and installation of new radar sensors that also work to alert SMRT and LTA in the event that water level is high, took three hours of work for 41 nights, he added. PUMP MAINTENANCE WORK OUTSOURCED Mr Siu, who was appointed to his role in the wake of the flooding incident which disrupted service for about 15 hours and affected 231,000 commuters, said that pump maintenance work has been outsourced to the original equipment manufacturer. “Equipment reliability will definitely go up. This means that the commuter can travel in a more reliable and comfortable way,” Mr Siu said. Previously, these contracted workers were only involved in corrective repair works. Maintenance tasks include visual inspection, cleaning float switches and operational tests. Such tasks will also be conducted more frequently, from quarterly or yearly to monthly.

(Photo: Ruyi Wong) SMRT employees who were previously involved in maintenance work will take on inspection and supervisory roles, Mr Siu said. The Land Transport Authority, which said the flooding incident was entirely preventable in an investigation report released in December last year, found that there were adequate flood protection measures and that float switches, pumps and the pump motor control panel were functional. However, it noted that a lack of maintenance, audits and managerial supervision could have led to the flooding incident. Floodwaters were up to 1m deep and spanned 100m of tracks in both directions.

The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) is reviewing formula milk import regulations and, if there are any changes, they could be finalised by the end of the year, he said. The Government will simplify and streamline import requirements and remove unnecessary barriers to entry in order to provide more options, he added. He also said the Government will take steps to increase consumer awareness, encourage good practices in hospitals and further tighten restrictions on labelling and advertising. In addition, the Ministry of Health will work with industry players to make available more infant formula options in hospitals, he said. He said the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) recently completed a market study, examining the milk formula industry, and the nature of competition at each level of the supply chain. The results of the study will be published this week, he said. Should there be any evidence of companies working together to increase prices, CCS will not hesitate to investigate, he added. He was responding to questions from Macpherson SMC Tin Pei Ling on why formula milk is more expensive here than in other comparable countries, and whether the Government will consider control measures to exert more pressure to keep prices fair. The MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol Sun Xueling asked how quickly import regulations will be changed. Advertisement Advertisement Dr Koh said education is needed to allay parents\' anxiety that they are shortchanging their children if they buy cheaper formula. \"We need to educate our consumers as well, that despite whatever pricing strategy they may have on the generic formula, or despite whatever claims there may be, all formula fulfil minimum nutritional requirements, and in fact are just as equally adequate,\" he said. He said that for a 900g tin, some milk powder is sold at around S$20 to S$30, while others brands can be priced at up to S$60. There should be no guilt on parents\' part about getting a cheaper brand of milk, as long as their child can get used to the milk. \"There\'s no real reason to pay up more for something that is just as good and much cheaper,\" he added. He said that some products may cost more due to research and development expenditure, and some of these kinds of milk are for a restricted group, who may have allergies or medical conditions. \"What we can do is to make sure we increase the choices that are available, the options that are available and where necessary, put in the necessary financial support,\" he said. One retailer has sounded its support for the Government\'s decision to review import regulations on formula milk. NTUC FairPrice CEO Seah Kian Peng said in a press release on Monday that the organisation shares the concerns among parents today on the cost of infant milk powder. \"We agree that more public education and understanding on the benefits of infant milk formula will help parents make more informed choices, and a review of import requirements will help us to provide better value options for our customers.” The organisation added that it provides more than 150 varieties of infant formula from different brands, formulations and pack sizes ranging from S$30 to slightly over S$100 per tin. Parenting portal Babyment.com has revealed prices of infant milk formula in Singapore increased by an average of about 27 per cent from December 2012 to March 2017.

Releasing findings of a market inquiry on Wednesday (May 10), the CCS said that total marketing expenditure by major manufacturers such as Abbott, Danone and Nestle increased by 42 per cent between 2010 and 2014. No figures were provided on research and development expenditure. The average retail price of formula milk has more than doubled over the past nine years, according to the Singapore Department of Statistics. The competition watchdog said that the rising price of formula milk provided the impetus behind its market inquiry, which was conducted between October 2015 and August 2016. The issue of high formula milk costs also came under the spotlight recently and was debated in Parliament on Monday. The CCS report found that manufacturers spend heavily on research and development as well as marketing in order to make their products appear premium, and build consumer loyalty to their brands. Advertisement Advertisement Manufacturers introduce new ingredients that contribute to attributes desired by parents, the competition watchdog said, adding that such ingredients make promises like improving overall mental function, promoting a healthy intestinal tract and aiding brain and eye development. The premium image is important to these brands because they compete against other brands and their products based on brand name, nutrition and safety, rather than on price, CCS said. Such strategies appear to have worked, with premium and specialty formula milk products that now cost about S$60 for a 900g tin making up an estimated 95 per cent of total sales in 2015, according to the CCS report. “Despite the similarity in nutritional standards with other countries, manufacturers often choose to bring premium formulation into Singapore,” CCS said, adding that to further build a “premium image”, some manufacturers import their formula milk products from Europe, Australia and New Zealand because they believe that consumers in Singapore have a preference for products from these places. Formula milk prices were found to be higher in Singapore than in countries like Japan, Indonesia and Australia. Anecdotal feedback suggested that some parents perceive more expensive brands as having better quality, CCS said. This could be due to manufacturers’ aggressive marketing and advertising efforts and the inability of parents to accurately assess the price versus quality trade-off. “Some parents may find it difficult to understand the nutritional content of formula milk, a child’s nutrient requirements and the significance of the additional “premium” ingredient,” the report said, adding that the parents may then rely on price as a quality indicator. In terms of marketing, manufacturers have devoted more effort to selling their products to hospitals. They provide sponsorship, payment, or both to private hospitals in particular, as private hospitals here are not part of the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative that prevents such arrangements. The three public hospitals here that offer maternity services - KK Women\'s and Children\'s Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, and National University Hospital - have been certified as part of the scheme. \"Such features of the formula milk market can present significant barriers to entry for new brands or barriers to expansion for existing brands which do not engage in such efforts,” CCS said. PROBLEMS WITH SELLING CHEAPER MILK In its inquiry, CCS found that cheaper formula milk may not necessarily enjoy higher sales. CCS cited a supermarket that had worked with a manufacturer to bring in a “value-for-money” formula milk product from an established brand in response to customer feedback on high prices. “Despite various marketing activities by the manufacturer, sales were weak and the product was discontinued by the manufacturer as it was not commercially viable and the manufacturer could not meet the minimum order quantity from its factories,” the watchdog said. CCS recommended that the public be educated on the nutritional content of formula milk and the nutritional requirements of infants and young children, and that consumer awareness on the availability of a variety of formula milk, including cheaper products, be increased. It also suggested lower barriers to entry by reviewing parallel importation rules, as well as the sponsorship and payments that manufacturers provide hospitals.

AVA will also streamline its import regulations in order to facilitate the entry of more suppliers and brands of formula milk. These changes are expected to be finalised by end of this year, AVA said in a joint media release with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Promotion Board (HPB) on Wednesday (May 10). The proposed changes in regulation come as a response to the recommendations by the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS), following a market inquiry into the formula milk industry. The inquiry found that prices of formula milk have been increasing due to manufacturers spending heavily on marketing as well as research and development. In its report, the watchdog recommended that the public be educated on the nutritional content of formula milk as well as the nutritional requirements of infants and young children. It called for greater consumer awareness regarding the availability of a variety of formula milk, including those that are cheaper. In their joint statement, the authorities said that the Government will adjust regulations to encourage better price competition, strengthen public education efforts and encourage all hospitals to provide stronger support for breastfeeding. Advertisement Advertisement HPB will mount a five-year campaign to step up public education on breastfeeding and its merits, especially in the infant\'s first year of life. Dr Chua Mei Chien, head of neonatology at KKH, said that scientific evidence suggests that breastfeeding helps to reduce the chance of developing obesity and diabetes later in life. \"For mothers, it reduces the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer,\" she said. HPB will also reinforce messages that cows\' milk is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of children above 12 months old, as part of a balanced diet. The competition watchdog\'s report also suggested reviewing sponsorship and payments that manufacturers provide hospitals. MOH said it will strongly encourage all hospitals providing maternity services to achieve the international Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative certification. Currently, none of the private hospitals has adopted this scheme, which prevents hospitals from entering into sponsorship arrangements with formula milk companies. MOH will also look into making available more affordable infant formula brands in the ready-to-feed form suitable for use in hospitals.

The latest national breast feeding survey in 2011 shows that 96.1 per cent of mothers breast feed their babies to some extent right after delivery but this number drops to 41.6 per cent six months after delivery, which indicates that many babies rely on infant milk formula either exclusively or partly for their nourishment. A standard can of 900 grams of infant formula purchased from a regular supermarket costs about S$56 on average, compared to S$25 in 2007. The price of infant formula has thus risen 120 per cent over 10 years, nearly twice as fast as nominal median incomes in Singapore, which rose 65.6 per cent over roughly the same period, placing a greater strain on household expenditures. Table showing percentage changes in median incomes and prices of infant milk powder in Singapore and in Western Europe with 2006 as base. (Graph: Sun Xueling, Sources: Various including Data.sg, MOM) Based on an online survey I conducted over three days, which over 2,500 respondents completed, parents with children younger than a year old spend about S$191 per month on infant milk formula on average. This represents 15.4 per cent of household expenditure on food for young families. Infant milk formula is thus not a small item of expenditure for young families. IS THE PRICING OF INFANT MILK FORMULA FAIR? Advertisement Advertisement A check on prices for similar cans of infant formula in Malaysia, Australia, UK and the US shows that a similar can of infant formula in Singapore costs 1.63 times the cost in Malaysia, 2.07 times the cost in Australia, 2.6 times the cost in the UK and 1.15 times the cost in the US, based on prices on websites at point of checks. Table showing prices of infant milk formula in Singapore relative to Malaysia, Australia, UK and the US. (Table: Sun Xueling. Sources: Various including RedMart, Lazada, NTUC Fairprice, Boots) While one may argue, for instance in the case of Malaysia, that business costs are generally higher in Singapore, regular milk sold in Singapore only costs 34 per cent more compared to Malaysia. Yet Wyeth’s S26 Stage 2 infant milk powder costs 63 per cent more in Singapore compared to Malaysia. Why has the price of infant formula risen so much? The explanation provided by major infant formula suppliers seems to point to efforts into research and development (R&D) for infant formula. A check on a similar can of infant formula from Malaysia and from Singapore also shows slight differences in the ingredient mix. Does the difference in the quantity of ingredients added to whole milk powder (for instance, cow’s milk) which then constitutes infant milk formula account for the higher prices of infant formula charged in Singapore? Has the formulation been changing consistently over time to warrant the repeated price increases in Singapore? And as to the R&D cited by major infant formula suppliers in Singapore, are the requirements of the Singapore market so different that R&D specific to Singapore is needed to warrant the sustained price increases in Singapore? CONCENTRATED INFANT FORMULA MARKET IN SINGAPORE Infant formula worldwide is dominated by five suppliers - Nestle, Abbott Nutrition, Groupe Danone, Mead Johnson Nutrition and the Kraft Heinz Company, accounting for about 60 per cent of the global market . The market is likely to be even more concentrated in Singapore, as based on my survey of 2,508 respondents conducted over three days, the top five suppliers in Singapore accounted for 89 per cent of the market. Other surveys suggest the market concentration in Singapore is even higher. Market share of top five major infant milk formula suppliers in Singapore, based on online survey of more than 2,500 respondents. (Chart: Sun Xueling) Interestingly, the other market that shows a high degree of concentration is the US, where the top four suppliers account for 92 per cent of the market in 2015. The US also shows high prices for infant milk formula. The high price of infant milk formula in Singapore could thus be related to the large market share the major suppliers of infant milk formula have here. To encourage more competition, Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament yesterday that the Government will simplify and streamline import requirements as well as remove unnecessary barriers to entry in order to bring in more options for parents without compromising food safety. Further, more infant formula options will be made available in hospitals. With more choices of infant milk formula available to consumers, more sources of supply and hence greater competition in the market, prices over time should level out. PARENTS’ MINDSETS ARE UNDERSTANDABLE Parents want the best for their children. They are willing to spend on good-quality infant formula because infant formula constitutes the sole source of nutrients for their young child if breast milk is not available. Further, infant formula is a short-term spending item. Young parents expect to spend on infant formula until their child becomes capable of consuming solid foods. As a result, they are willing to incur high expenses in the short term to buy good quality infant formula. These pre-existing mindsets of parents, which are understandable, logical and well-meaning, create a conducive environment for suppliers of infant formula, who can use this to their advantage. I look forward to the Competition Commission of Singapore’s findings later this week on the market structure of infant formula in Singapore and the behaviour of the market\'s main. This should shed light as to whether there is anti-competitive behaviour. We need to ensure that the interests of parents and, indirectly, the interests of young children are being taken care of and not taken advantage of. ETHICAL MARKETING OF INFANT FORMULA IN SINGAPORE A survey respondent left a comment on my Facebook, which is worth highlighting: My boy of seven months is already drinking 250 millilitres and the price of FM (infant formula milk) is taking a toll on us. I believe that the brand of FM is priced not in terms of just the brand but the quality and research behind it. As a mother, I want to give my baby the best even if it’s taking a toll on us … Some say no money buy cheaper brand, it’s all the same … No! I will try to give my baby the best! And what’s good for his health! Parents want the best for their child and they are afraid to short-change their child. Such mindsets open them up to being taken advantage of if they are not careful. Any shopper to a supermarket in Singapore will observe that within an array of infant formula brands, certain brands aggressively market improvements in IQ that accompany the consumption of their infant milk powder. This improvement in IQ is purportedly a result of the addition of certain special ingredients in their infant milk formula. The interesting use of mortar boards in advertising also sublimely reminds parents to purchase infant formula that helps their child get ahead academically. As Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon shared in Parliament on May 8: “While some infant formula companies give the impression that their particular brand of milk or milk powder can do more for children, the scientific evidence for this is weak.” It is thus timely that the Health Promotion Board’s Sale of Infant Food Ethics Committee is supporting an ongoing review to extend coverage of the code of ethics restricting advertising, marketing and promotion of infant formula to all infant formula for up to 12 months of age. The standards in Singapore should be in conformity to international standards on ethical marketing. HELP FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES In the meantime, help is needed for low-income families who may face difficulties purchasing infant milk formula for their young children. The S$1.5 million milk fund scheme launched by NTUC Fairprice and the five CDCs (Community Development Councils) in February, which will benefit up to 7,500 children from low-income families is timely. With its disbursement in S$20 denominations to a total of S$200, the NTUC vouchers could potentially offset 40 per cent of the cost of a tin of milk powder with each purchase. And assuming a young child consumes about three tins a month, the vouchers will help a family for three to four months, a significant period in the development of a young child, before he or she can consume solids. Parents want the best for their children. While we continue to advocate breastfeeding as the best form of nutrition for young children, infant formula acts as a supplement to breastfeeding in some cases, or as the sole source of nutrients in others. Providing more options to parents and ensuring the availability of accurate information is thus key to ensuring fair pricing and appropriate marketing of infant milk formula. The rights of consumers, in this case well-meaning parents who want the best for their young children, should be protected. Sun Xueling is a Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

Lawyer Peter Pang said he had advised Alzahrani and the Saudi embassy that the application was likely to fail, but that they had “insisted that I should proceed”. He was rapped by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon for abuse of process. Alzahrani’s appeal against his conviction and sentence had been dismissed by the High Court in July last year. Following this, Mr Pang, acting on his clients’ instructions, filed an application to refer questions of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal. However, his “questions” alleged that Alzahrani’s previous lawyer had made a blunder in conducting his defence, and that the diplomat had not had a fair and impartial trial. The apex court – including CJ Menon and Judges of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang and Judith Prakash – threw out Mr Pang’s application. Advertisement Advertisement “That is not a question of law, much less a question of law of public interest … that is a question of fact,” the CJ said, noting that the High Court judge had addressed these issues at Alzahrani’s appeal when he affirmed the conviction and sentence. “The present application is a classic example of a back-door appeal,” Deputy Public Prosecutors Hay Hung Chun and Kenny Yap said. They sought S$5,000 in costs against Mr Pang. “Counsel should have known better than to facilitate the filing of this frivolous application,” they told the court. CJ Menon noted that Mr Pang had been told by the High Court that what he had put forward were not \"questions of law\" and therefore unlikely to be allowed. Still, the lawyer persisted and, in doing so, had conducted himself unreasonably, the apex court said. The S$5,000 will be given to the Law Society of Singapore, which administers the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. Alzahrani, 40, was sentenced to 26 months and one week in jail and four strokes of the cane in February last year, after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a female hotel employee. Alzahrani, who was attached to the Saudi embassy in Beijing, was on holiday in Singapore in 2016 with his wife and three children when he committed the offences. He was alone with a 20-year-old intern in a hotel room when he groped her and forced her to touch him, prosecutors said. Alzahrani also lifted the young woman’s dress and rubbed his groin against her buttocks, they added. He was convicted of two charges of aggravated outrage of modesty and one charge of using criminal force. Alzahrani is not protected by diplomatic immunity in Singapore because he was stationed in Beijing. Currently serving his jail term, he appeared in court on Thursday in handcuffs and dressed in a purple prison jumpsuit.

Gerald Kok Zhin Oi is also banned from owning an animal for one year from the date he is released from jail. Kok was convicted of four of seven charges of abusing Treasure the toy poodle on multiple occasions between July and December 2016. He admitted to hitting the three-year-old dog with a sofa cushion and plastic clothes hanger, and repeatedly flinging Treasure against the wall. “It all started in July when Treasure bit (Kok) for no reason,” Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) prosecutor Yap Teck Chuan said. The dog belonged to Kok’s girlfriend’s brother, who installed a CCTV camera in his bedroom to keep on an eye on Treasure. He suspected Kok had hit Treasure, and told his mother not to leave Kok alone with the dog. Advertisement Advertisement Kok admitted he ill-treated the dog on a few occasions over the following months, culminating in the fatal incident on Christmas Day in 2016. The family left the house at about 5.20pm on Dec 25, leaving Kok alone with Treasure. At the void deck, Kok’s girlfriend’s mother recalled her son telling her not to leave Kok alone with the dog. Kok’s girlfriend returned to the flat immediately, and caught Kok standing near her bedroom with bloodied tissue. She saw Treasure lying bloodied and motionless on the floor. She took the dog to the vet, where Treasure was pronounced dead. An X-ray showed it had suffered neck and skull fractures due to blunt force trauma to the head. Kok had lied that he was carrying Treasure to the bedroom when he slipped and fell, the prosecutor said. However, the CCTV camera had captured Kok hitting the dog and flinging it across the bed. DOG SUFFERED PROLONGED ABUSE: PROSECUTOR The prosecutor sought three-and-a-half months’ jail, saying Treasure had suffered prolonged abuse and must have been traumatised. Defence lawyer Josephus Tan said 10 weeks’ jail would be appropriate, and objected to the prosecutor’s remark: “He is not a dog whisperer,” the lawyer said, and should not be allowed to say Treasure felt traumatised. In sentencing Kok to three months’ jail and banning him from becoming a pet owner for one year, District Judge May Mesenas urged Kok to seek help. “There are consequences when you give vent to your anger. Only you know what triggered it, but you need to get some help so it doesn’t happen again,” she told Kok, encouraging him to reflect on his actions while behind bars. For ill-treating Treasure, Kok could have been jailed for up to 18 months and fined up to S$15,000 on each charge.

Kenneth Ong Yi Jie pleaded guilty to 41 of 258 charges on Tuesday, most for insulting the modesty of unsuspecting victims. He had installed hidden cameras in the washrooms of various places including universities, churches, cafes and changing rooms. He even installed one in his own washroom before inviting several female friends to his home. “The cameras are either hidden from sight, or take the form of innocuous items like wall hooks,” Deputy Public Prosecutors Tang Shangjun and Li Yihong said. Ong, who was caught after three years, regularly shared these films – which clearly showed each victim’s face and private parts – online, on a forum called Sammyboy. “Such a systematic and large-scale violation of the privacy of women and girls in public toilets and changing rooms causes considerable public concern,” the prosecutor said. Advertisement Advertisement Calling Ong’s case the worst of its kind, the prosecutor urged the court to put Ong behind bars for at least 39 months. “There has never been another case involving such large-scale filming of victims via the use of hidden cameras,\" he said. Ong posted so much material online that other users asked him to teach them how he did it. On at least one occasion, Ong met up with a forum user, 25-year-old Clarence Tang Jia Ming at Holland Village, where he showed Tang how to install a hidden camera inside the toilet cubicle at Starbucks. He even gave Tang a camera to get him started, the court heard. Ong was “skilled in camera placement” and taught Tang “the best viewing angles,” said the prosecutor. Ong also chose places frequented by schoolgirls and women aged 18 to 25. These locations included the Church of Singapore in Bukit Timah, Nanyang Polytechnic, SIM University, several McDonald\'s outlets, and cafes at Lorong Kilat in Upper Bukit Timah. Another user, 28-year-old Shaun Lee, gave Ong money to buy more cameras so he could take more videos and share them with him. Lee has been charged and is expected to plead guilty on Feb 22. Ong’s home was raided on Nov 30, 2016, after he was identified based on information from another user caught before him. Two men caught in connection with Ong’s case have been jailed: Joel Chew Wei Chen was jailed for six months, while Ali V P Mohamed, who started a voyeuristic video-sharing group that grew to 200 members, was jailed for two years. As for Tang, he has been charged with 70 counts of insulting the modesty of a woman, and has yet to be dealt with. Ong’s lawyer said his client, who has seen an addiction specialist, “suffers from a certain tendency”. He also alluded to a history of “issues”, although he refused to say what they were because members of the media were present in court. However, the prosecutor argued that Ong’s diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is not a mitigating factor in the case. “The prospect of these explicit films of their faces and genitalia being viewed across the web, with no reasonable expectation that they can ever be removed completely from circulation, is a source of unending distress, humiliation and trauma for the victims,” the prosecutor said. For insulting the modesty of a woman, Ong could have been jailed for up to one year per charge and fined.

Wong Mee Keow, 39, pleaded guilty on Monday to two charges of lying to the police in 2006. Another charge of obstructing the course of justice was taken into account during sentencing. Wong\'s lies derailed an investigation for a decade. In 2006, an investigation was launched when the teachers of two Chinese students realised they had performed very poorly in exams despite having passed an entrance exam to get into the school. When they were confronted, the students admitted that their Chinese agents had arranged for them to skip the exam and still win a place in the school. An investigation into the agents led the police to Wong’s Pivot Tuition Centre and an employee by the name of Poh Yuan Nie, Deputy Public Prosecutor Vadivalagan Shanmuga said. When questioned by the police in August and November 2006, Wong pretended she had no idea who Poh, also known as Pony, was. With no leads, the police dropped the investigation against Pony. Advertisement Advertisement A decade later, Pony was arrested for another examination cheating scam that she had perpetrated with other accomplices in 2015 and 2016. Wong attempted to protect Pony again by deleting photographs of the woman from her mobile phone to prevent the police from identifying her. The two are in a relationship, said Wong\'s lawyer, Peter Ong Lip Cheng. Court documents did not provide further details on the investigations or how the alleged scams were carried out. However, Pony was eventually arrested and charged. Among other charges, the 52-year-old is accused of conspiring with three others to cheat the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board into believing a student, Chen Yi, had sat for the GCE O-Level English Paper 1 without assistance. Court documents allege Pony, together with Fiona Poh Min, Tan Jia Yen and Feng Riwen, helped Chen to cheat on the exam on Oct 24, 2016. The trio are also accused of perverting the course of justice by instigating Chen to leave the country in the face of a police investigation. She faces 38 charges for allegedly helping several people cheat in their O-Level examinations. Pony, who was in court to support Wong on Monday, will go on trial in April this year. For lying to the police, Wong could have been sentenced to up to six months\' jail and fined up to S$1,000, per charge.

Ramachandra Chandramohan, 35, Gunasegaran Rajendran, 36, and Jaya Kumar Krishnasamy, 30, were convicted of seven, two and three charges respectively. The men created a ruckus on Feb 3, 2015, after police officers pulled the music troupe they had hired out of the procession. The playing of musical instruments was banned at all foot processions, including religious events. The ban had been in place since 1973 until authorities relaxed the rule in late 2015 following feedback from members of the community. On Friday, District Judge Kessler Soh acknowledged the trio’s unhappiness at the “rough, loud and rude” way they thought the police had treated them. “You felt you were not being treated sensitively, considering that this was a religious procession. You felt manhandled,” Judge Soh said. However, the judge found that the officers involved had not behaved hard-handedly or unprofessionally. “They were there to maintain public order … and had in fact tried to diffuse the situation and calm things down,” he said. Advertisement Advertisement In the chaos of it all, Ramachandra and Gunasegaran had “overreacted”, the judge added. FOOTAGE SHOWED MEN\'S VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR When police officers stepped in to tell the urumi troupe, or Indian drum players to stop their live performance, Ramachandra and Gunasegaran became upset. They had hired the troupe to support Gunasegaran’s brother, who was carrying the kavadi. Footage from police cameras showed that the duo became aggressive. They “shouted at top of their voices and gesticulated wildly with their hands”, Deputy Public Prosecutor Houston Johannus said, adding that they turned violent when officers tried to arrest them. Footage played in court at the men’s trial in 2016 showed a chaotic scene of devotees in protest and a heavy police presence at the junction of Serangoon Road and Desker Road, where the incident happened. At one point, the police were forced to form a human barricade in an attempt to control the crowd. The men’s friend, Jaya Kumar Krishnasamy, tried to breach the human barricade to stop officers from arresting his friends and taking them away in a police van. He was also arrested. Ramachandra was convicted of seven charges, including three for assaulting three policemen, two for hurling vulgarities at an officer and one for disorderly behaviour. Both he and Gunasegaran were also convicted of deliberately wounding the religious feelings of a Muslim officer by insulting Allah. Jaya Kumar was convicted of three charges - one for disorderly behaviour, one for verbally abusing a police officer and one for obstructing an officer in the discharge of his duty. The prosecutor had said at a previous hearing that the incident occurred amid a “sensitive and explosive mix of factors prevalent at the material time”. “The incident had occurred in the midst of a religious festival, (and) the disorderly behaviour was displayed in defiance of police authority ... just over a year after the Little India riots in 2013,” he noted. The prosecutor will make sentencing submissions before the judge on Mar 6. For disorderly behaviour, the men could face up to one month in jail or a fine of up to S$1,000. For assaulting the three policemen, Ramachandra could be jailed for up to seven years and fined or caned. For wounding the religions feelings of the Muslim officer, Ramachandra and Gunasegaran could face up to three years\' jail, a fine or both. For verbally abusing the police, Ramachandra and Jaya Kumar could face up to 12 months\' jail and a fine of up to S$5,000.

This means Kong, his former deputy Tan Ye Peng and senior members Chew Eng Han, John Lam, Serina Wee and Sharon Tan will continue to serve reduced jail terms of seven months to three and a half years, slashed from between 21 months and eight years. Former finance manager Sharon Tan, 41, has completed her seven-month sentence and is now a free woman. Former fund manager Chew, 57, will begin serving his sentence of three years and four months on Feb 22. “A HARD CASE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MAKE BAD LAW”: APEX COURT On Thursday, the Court of Appeal moved to uphold the High Court’s decision to convict the City Harvest six of less serious criminal breach of trust (CBT) charges. Though Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang acknowledged the “lacuna,” or gap, in the law brought to light in this case, he said the five-judge Court of Appeal would not “paper over” it. Advertisement Advertisement “A hard case should not be allowed to make bad law,” Judge Phang said. “The shaping of a remedy should be left to Parliament,” he added, noting that “the separation of powers … is the bedrock of our Constitution”. In a procedure known as a Criminal Reference, the prosecution had argued at a hearing last year that the original convictions of the City Harvest six ought to have been upheld. The six were found guilty in 2015 of taking S$50 million from the church’s coffers to secretly bankroll the music career of Kong’s wife, singer Sun Ho. They were convicted of the most serious form of CBT under section 409 of the Penal Code, reserved for public servants, bankers, merchants or agents and carrying a jail term of up to 20 years or life. All six appealed. In a shock split decision in April last year, the High Court overturned the convictions, and opted instead to convict the six of the least serious form of CBT, which carries up to seven years’ jail. The High Court’s split 2-1 decision hinged on the definition of the word “agent”. Kong and the others did not act as “professional agents,” so do not fall under the ambit of section 409, the court had said. Though the High Court conceded their judgement was “intuitively unsatisfactory,” “we cannot ignore the wording of the law,” it said. The apex court affirmed this decision on Thursday, ruling that the text of section 409 only encompasses “professional agents” engaged in commercial activities. Directors and societies and charities do not fall under the scope of section 409, Judge Phang said. These are the consequences of “dated legislation,” the court said, urging Parliament to conduct a “wide-ranging policy review” that he said is long-overdue. Still, it should be remembered that the six are not going away unpunished, Judge Phang added. In August last year, Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair had argued that if allowed to stand, the High Court’s “absurd” decision would mean that “high-ranking directors … are subject to less severe punishment than low-ranking employees”. The Senior Counsel urged the apex court to come to other “possible, reasonable” interpretations of the law to remedy the situation. Lawyers for the six had argued this gap in the law should be filled by legislation, as it is the job of Parliament – not the Court of Appeal – to construct laws. In a statement on Thursday, lawyers for City Harvest Church said they were \"very thankful for the outcome and relieved that this episode is finally over\". \"This sense of certainty helps us as we continue to wait for the respective releases,” they said in a statement.

Su Fengxian is intending to appeal against her conviction and sentence, her lawyer Alfred Dodwell confirmed. Su was found guilty on Jan 2 of offering the bribe to Mr Loy on Oct 17, 2016, three days after Li told his mother he faced disciplinary action for allowing his girlfriend to spend the night at his dormitory on several occasions, violating house rules. Li was sacked a week later. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jasmin Kaur sought at least four months’ jail, citing aggravating factors in the case including the potential damage to Singapore’s international reputation. “Table tennis has been recognised as one of Singapore’s seven core sports, and the national team has delivered exceptional results in international tournaments,” Ms Kaur said. As Singapore table tennis “enjoys great visibility and enhanced reputation … a strong signal must be sent to deter any attempt to bribe STTA officials … so as to minimise or reduce the potential damage to Singapore’s reputation in the international sporting arena that may be caused by the taint of corruption,” the prosecutor added. Advertisement Advertisement Mr Dodwell, Su’s lawyer, had urged the court to impose a fine. In sentencing Su to six weeks’ jail, District Judge Chay Yuan Fatt said it is in the public interest to protect the integrity of STTA officials, as table tennis is one of Singapore’s high-profile sports. Su is on bail of S$15,000 pending the hearing of her appeal. Her son is a Singapore citizen and owns a flat here, Mr Dodwell said. Su and her husband are retired and have sold everything in China to move to Singapore to live with Li, he added. For bribery, Su could have been jailed up to five years and fined up to S$10,000.

Kang Chun How had owned the pistol since 2012, the same year he prepared an explosive substance - a mixture of potassium nitrate and sucrose known as “R Candy” or “Rocket Candy” - a District Court heard. He learned how to make the explosive online, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan said. Kang had also searched the Internet for instructions on “how to make sparkler rockets” and “improvised weapon”. A number of searches related to rocket valves were also discovered, the prosecutor said. When narcotics officers visited his home in Yishun in September 2015, they recovered seven cartridges. Kang claimed that he had obtained them from friends, but was unable to give the authorities any contact details, said the prosecutor. When officers searched Kang’s flat that day, they found one packet of “vegetable matter” – later found to be cannabis mixture – as well as the airsoft pistol, boxes of pellets, a knife and several bottles of chemical mixtures. Kang was arrested on the spot, and his urine later tested positive for a controlled drug. Advertisement Advertisement He is expected to be sentenced on Feb 21. For his offences under the Arms and Explosives Act, Kang could face up to three years in jail and a fine of up to S$10,000, per charge. For the consumption and possession of the controlled drug, Kang could face up to 10 years’ jail and/or a fine of up to S$20,000.

The child’s mother, 36, was fined S$5,000 for lying about the family’s address to the vice-principal of the school. Her husband, 38, was fined S$4,000 for duping an officer at Serangoon Gardens Neighbourhood Police Post into changing the couple’s official addresses on their identity cards. The parents cannot be named to protect the child’s identity. In 2014, the parents of the child, who was then five, paid a visit to their neighbourhood police post to change their registered address to one in the Bishan area. The family in fact lived in a bungalow in Serangoon Gardens. The following year, the mother used the fake address to register her child for Primary 1 at a school in Bishan, under Phase 2C of the registration exercise. Families living within one kilometre of a school are given priority. The school’s vice-principal accepted the application, and the child was given a place in the school. In January 2016, the month the child started Primary 1, the vice-principal realised that the mother had lied about her home address and lodged a police report. Advertisement Advertisement According to Ministry of Education (MOE) rules, a child who was successfully registered in a school based on false information will be transferred to another school with available vacancies. In this particular case, however, the child is still studying in the school in Bishan as the parents have 14 days to appeal against their sentence should they require, MOE told Channel NewsAsia in response to queries. \"MOE will decide on the best course of action for the child at a later stage. In the meantime, the school will continue to care for and ensure the well-being of the student,\" the ministry said. It added that it views the use of false addresses during the Primary 1 Registration Exercise as a serious matter, and will refer any suspected cases to the police. There have been fewer than 10 reported cases in the last 10 years, said MOE. For lying to the vice-principal, a public servant, the mother could have been jailed for up to one year and/or fined up to S$5,000. As for the father, who was convicted of one count of giving a false address under the National Registration Act, he could have been jailed for up to five years and/or fined up to S$5,000.

Lim Sin Ann pleaded guilty to two counts of vandalism on Friday. Another two charges, including one for stealing a PAssion card, were taken into consideration during sentencing. Lim admitted that while in a bad mood in the early hours of Nov 6, 2017, he decided to burn three police cameras, also known as POLCAMs, at Block 212 Boon Lay Place. To reach the cameras, Lim stood on a stool he had retrieved from his flat. He then set some newspapers alight and held it up to the camera. Lim did this to three POLCAMs, using an umbrella to shield himself from the cameras each time. As a result of the vandalism, the lenses of the POLCAMs were blackened, and subsequent recording was “significantly blurred”, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kayal Pillay said. Each POLCAM cost the Singapore Police Force S$327 to repair, she said, noting Lim did not make restitution. Advertisement Advertisement Lim was sentenced to three months’ jail for his actions, and an additional month in lieu of caning. The punishment for vandalism is a fine of up to S$2,000 or to up to three years’ jail and caning. As Lim is above 50, he cannot be caned.

These allegations mean the Shell conspiracy – for which 14 have been charged so far over multiple heists – continued for at least five months. Singaporeans Alan Tan Cheng Chuan, 45, and Ng Hock Teck, 54, face one additional charge each for receiving 764.81 metric tonnes of stolen fuel worth S$252,557.98 on Jul 24, 2017. The fuel was allegedly transferred from the plant onto Singapore-registered vessel Sentek 26. They were first charged on Jan 13 with one count of receiving stolen property – more fuel worth S$160,000 – in the same manner on Nov 11. A Vietnamese national, Doan Xuan Than, 45, also faced an additional charge of conspiring with Shell employee Koh Choon Wei to receive 1,133 metric tonnes of stolen fuel worth US$639,725.79 on Dec 1. The fuel was allegedly transferred from the plant onto Panama-registered vessel MT Gaea. He was first charged alongside Tan and Ng on Jan 13 with one count of receiving stolen property – more fuel worth S$736,444.80 – in the same manner on Dec 31.

Bander Yahya A Alzahrani, 39, is not protected by diplomatic immunity in Singapore because he was attached to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Beijing. The offence was committed on Aug 14, 2016, when he was on holiday in Singapore with his wife and three children. The court heard that Alzahrani cornered the 20-year-old victim in the bathroom of his Sentosa hotel room, where he sexually assaulted her for about 15 minutes. He restrained the victim by hugging her, before groping her, kissing her face and neck and rubbing himself against her. He also forced her to touch him. Alzahrani was convicted on Wednesday on three counts of sexual assault. In sentencing, District Judge Lee Poh Choo noted that Alzahrani had molested the victim twice in the space of 15 minutes. “To a victim, one minute could seem a lifetime”, the judge said. Advertisement Advertisement Although she questioned the “wisdom of sending a young female intern, alone, to show a room to a male guest”, Judge Lee commended hotel staff for coaxing the victim into telling them what had happened and for getting the police involved, when the hotel could have “hushed up the matter in favour of their guest”. Defence lawyer Shashi Nathan said Alzahrani “maintains his innocence” and will appeal his conviction and sentence. The matter has been “deeply embarrassing” for Alzahrani, who is “a well-respected individual and a person of good character”, said Mr Nathan. Alzahrani will remain in Singapore pending the hearing of his appeal. He is on bail of S$20,000.

Diplomat Bander Yahya A Alzahrani’s jail term of 26 months and one week, and four strokes of the cane, was also upheld. He will start serving his sentence on Jul 28. Alzahrani was found guilty of three charges – including one for molest and two for aggravated molest – in February, after an eight-day trial. The Beijing-based diplomat had been in Singapore on holiday with his wife and three children on Aug 14, 2016, when he committed the offences. Alzahrani was alone with the victim, who was showing him around a hotel room, when he cornered her in the bathroom and sexually assaulted her. He also forced her to touch him. The diplomat claimed the woman had accused him of molesting her in order to extort money from him. In the High Court on Friday, defence lawyer Shashi Nathan urged Judge of Appeal Steven Chong to re-look at the evidence, in the form of closed-circuit television footage of Alzahrani and the victim walking out of the hotel room after the assault. Advertisement Advertisement “What I see is this … absolutely no distress at all, no caution, no fear,” Mr Nathan said, adding that the pair were in “close proximity”, walking side by side down the hotel corridor. “Had she been the victim of such a horrible act, one would not think that that would be her demeanour,” Mr Nathan said. But he conceded Alzahrani’s DNA had been found on the back of the woman’s dress, although the diplomat gave “inconsistent” explanations as to why. Judge of Appeal Steven Chong said he was “troubled” by Alzahrani’s account of how his DNA came to be found on the victim’s dress. His account is “reflective of a person who knew there was contact, but hoped to avoid disclosure … until he was confronted by DNA evidence”, the judge said. Deputy public prosecutor April Phang said the victim was a “naïve, young, timid girl”, and her demeanour after the offences “shows a young lady who was still trying to do her job under trying circumstances … (she put) the client and institution above herself and (did not) just run screaming from the room”, Ms Phang said. The prosecutor also pointed out Alzahrani had been “nothing but dishonest through the entirety of the proceedings”. His defence “had more holes than a sieve”, she said, pointing out Alzahrani had offered “so many conflicting accounts” of the incident, even claiming the victim could have “imagined things”. In upholding Alzahrani’s conviction and sentence, Judge Chong said his appeal was “completely unmeritorious,” and that his conviction is “fully supported” by the evidence. “The sentence is actually lenient,” the judge said.

Diplomat Bander Yahya A Alzahrani’s jail term of 26 months and one week, and four strokes of the cane, was also upheld. He will start serving his sentence on Jul 28. Alzahrani was found guilty of three charges – including one for molest and two for aggravated molest – in February, after an eight-day trial. The Beijing-based diplomat had been in Singapore on holiday with his wife and three children on Aug 14, 2016, when he committed the offences. Alzahrani was alone with the victim, who was showing him around a hotel room, when he cornered her in the bathroom and sexually assaulted her. He also forced her to touch him. The diplomat claimed the woman had accused him of molesting her in order to extort money from him. In the High Court on Friday, defence lawyer Shashi Nathan urged Judge of Appeal Steven Chong to re-look at the evidence, in the form of closed-circuit television footage of Alzahrani and the victim walking out of the hotel room after the assault.

Beijing-based diplomat Bander Yahya A Alzahrani, 39, was convicted on three charges of sexual assault after an eight-day trial, during which he claimed the victim had conspired with other hotel staff to frame him and extort money from him. District Judge Lee Poh Choo rejected Alzahrani’s defence, finding that the victim had no reason to falsely implicate him. On the contrary, the victim’s account had to be “dragged out” of her, as she was worried the episode would be “interpreted negatively”, and that she would be seen as “unsuitable for the hotel industry”, the judge said. The court heard that on Aug 14 last year, Alzahrani cornered the victim in the bathroom of his Sentosa hotel room, where he sexually assaulted her for about 15 minutes. He restrained the victim by hugging her, before groping her, kissing her face and neck and rubbing himself against her. He also forced her to touch him. Judge Lee said that the fact that the victim did not shout for help or attempt to escape should not diminish her case. “There is no template for how a victim should or must react. It was obvious to me that the victim was timid and new to the real and harsh world”, she said. Advertisement Advertisement She also said the victim should not be faulted for minor discrepancies in her evidence as it was “most unfortunate\" that the police officers assigned to interview the victim were male and the woman was too embarrassed to detail what Alzahrani had done to her. The diplomat, meanwhile, was “not a credible witness”, the judge said, pointing out that it was only towards the end of the trial that Alzahrani claimed the victim had fallen on him and that he had placed both hands on her back to support her. Alzahrani is expected to be sentenced on Friday. For using criminal force on the victim, he could be jailed for up to three months and fined up to S$1,500. For aggravated molest, he faces between two and 10 years’ jail and caning.

Bander Yahya A Alzahrani had applied for a stay of his sentence of 26 months and one week as well as four strokes of the cane, pending a hearing in January before the Court of Appeal. However, the High Court on Friday (Nov 3) rejected his application. Alzahrani, 40, was in February found guilty of three charges of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old hotel employee. The offence was committed in August 2016 while he was in Singapore on holiday with his wife and three children. Alzahrani was alone with the victim, who was showing him around a hotel room, when he cornered her in the bathroom and sexually assaulted her. He also forced her to touch him. His lawyer Pang Giap Oon alleged on Friday that the diplomat’s previous lawyer had “erred” and “jeopardised” the case. He intends to refer three purported points of law to the Court of Appeal in January. Advertisement Advertisement THREE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO DEFER SENTENCE In July this year, Alzahrani had his appeal dismissed. He subsequently made two separate, successful requests to defer his sentence. However, when the diplomat attempted to defer his sentence for the third time in August, Judge of Appeal Steven Chong threw out his application. Alzahrani started serving his sentence on Aug 11, and appeared in court on Friday in handcuffs, with his head shaved and dressed in a purple prison jumpsuit. Deputy Public Prosecutors April Phang and Kenny Yang argued against Alzahrani’s release from prison pending the January hearing, on the grounds that such a decision was beyond the High Court’s power. “This court does not have the jurisdiction to stay the applicant’s (Alzahrani) sentence,” the prosecutors said. They cited the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the trial or appellate court can grant a deferment pending an appeal. As Alzahrani’s appeal has been dismissed, the code does not apply in this case, the prosecutors said. They also noted that the diplomat had started serving his sentence following the dismissal of his appeal, and that the code “does not allow for a suspension of sentence after an accused has commenced serving that sentence,” they said. Prosecutors argued that only the Court of Appeal has that power. “Both logically and as a matter of law, it is no longer possible to (stay the sentence),” the prosecutors said. Judge Chong disagreed. He said the High Court does indeed have the power to order a stay in sentence, even after an offender has started his jail term. As long as the sentence has not yet been completed, “there is still (part of the) sentence left to be (stayed),” he said. But this power should only be exercised if there is a good reason to do so, the judge added. He indicated that he would release written grounds addressing this point at a later date.

In a statement, the AGC said it has written to Mr Neo Aik Chau about a post he published on a Facebook group on Feb 2, which made reference to the widely publicised Feb 1 decision of the Court of Appeal ruling in favour of the accused people involved with City Harvest Church (CHC). Speaking in Parliament earlier on Monday, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said that the AGC was looking into a piece of “fake news” relating to the CHC saga as a case of contempt by scandalising the courts. After announcing the Government’s view of the sentences as “too low”, he was asked by Member of Parliament (MP) Gan Thiam Poh for his take on the public commenting how the CHC case was handled by a lawyer who is also an MP from the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) - Mr Edwin Tong of Marine Parade. In response, Mr Shanmugam gave an example of a public Facebook group which last week circulated a doctored front page image of local Chinese tabloid Lianhe Wanbao. The original, translated title of “Outdated law \'saved\' the accused from harsher penalties” had been changed to “PAP lawyer \'saved\' the accused from harsher penalties\". Front page of Lianhe Wanbao (left) and doctored front page circulated on Feb 2, 2018. (Image: MHA) Advertisement Advertisement Mr Shanmugam said: “AGC takes the view that the suggestion from the fake title is that the PAP MP was responsible for an unfair, unjust outcome and the Courts have let off the defendants lightly because of him. “The matter is with AGC and will be dealt with in accordance with the law.” “This sort of attack based on deliberate faking is quite unacceptable,” he continued. “I cannot see how any reasonable person will justify such faking as a legitimate expression of free speech.” Earlier, Mr Shanmugam also said that attacks on the CHC judges “ascribing improper ulterior motives to their decision” was “a clear case of abusing the anonymity of the Net”. “People who abuse judges, challenge their integrity, will be prosecuted if a case for contempt can be made out. Courts should be free to decide in accordance with what they believe the law to be, and criminal cases must be tried in the court of law - not in the court of public opinion.” He added: “We don’t want to end up like the United Kingdom, where the press freely attacks the judiciary. You get newspaper headlines labelling judges as enemies of the people, because the courts had the temerity to decide in a way the media did not like. If we are not careful we will easily go down that route.” “I’ve asked the police to take a serious view of those who scandalise court - not only for this case, if there are other comments which cross the threshold and are in contempt of court, our approach is that action will be taken,” Mr Shanmugam noted. “In coming to a decision whether to prosecute for scandalising the courts, the factors will include assessing who said it, how seriously is the statement likely to be taken, how wide was the publication, and other relevant factors.” “SHAMEFUL” TO “HOUND” LAWYERS Mr Shanmugam also emphasised that defendants were entitled to lawyers of their choice and lawyers “should not be made to feel they will be hounded online” should they take up certain cases. “Rule of law, a civilised system of having trials in court, depend amongst other things, on lawyers being able to act for defendants, whatever offences the defendants are accused of,” he explained. “Even a child rapist is entitled to his day in court, and to be defended. It doesn’t mean that we, or the lawyer defending the person, approves of child rape.” Mr Shanmugam then shared a personal example from when he was a lawyer in practice. “I am probably in the unique position, in Singapore, someone who has both acted for the three PMs of Singapore, and also of having acted against all three of them,” he said. “In 1995, PM Goh (Chok Tong), SM Lee (Kuan Yew) and DPM Lee (Hsien Loong) as they were then, sued the International Herald Tribune (IHT) for libel. The IHT came to me. The conversation as to whether I will act for them took about two minutes. I told them they must know I was a PAP MP. Were they comfortable, that they will get the best possible advice from me, given my position?” “They said it was ok with them, if it was ok with me. It was ok with me. I didn’t see any need to clear with the Party or anyone connected to the Party or Government. By taking on the case, I was simply doing my professional duty.” “I didn’t need to take on the brief. I was very busy with other work. But I thought the IHT had a right to Counsel of its choice. They were faced, obviously, with particularly formidable plaintiffs and hoped to get Counsel of their choice. And so I should help the IHT,” said Mr Shanmugam. “The import of my acting for the IHT, and it went to court, did not escape SM Lee Kuan Yew. In court, after his evidence was over, and before he stepped out of the witness box, he said he had to point out the situation. He said that I was close to the three of them, meaning the PM, SM and DPM. I was a PAP MP. The decision by the IHT, despite the situation, to instruct me was, I quote, the ‘highest tribute to the integrity of the Counsel’, and ‘possibly reflected also on the integrity of the Government’.” “Over the years, I have also acted for various others whose conduct will not be approved of by the general public, and some of whom were impecunious and could not pay fees.” Mr Shanmugam concluded: “The headline that I referred to earlier in the Facebook page, is part of a mob mentality to hound lawyers, to intimidate them into not acting in cases which the mob disapproves of. It is quite shameful.” “Supposing no action is taken when public Facebook pages do this, then what is there to prevent the media itself from publishing such articles in the future?” “We should not get there. It will be a sad day for Singapore, if we do get there.” Source: CNA/jo Tagged Topics city harvest church Edwin Tong K Shanmugam AGC Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail Bookmark Get the Channel NewsAsia newsletter in your inbox Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

In a statement on Thursday (Feb 8), MyHSR Corp said the exercise that ended on Jan 31 received more than 35,000 responses, the highest amount of feedback among rail-based public transportation projects in Malaysia. About 95 per cent of feedback received from visitors and survey respondents were supportive of the HSR project, with 98 per cent of positive responses received from Kuala Lumpur and Johor. The exercise provided the public with the opportunity to view information about the project such as the planned alignment, locations of the seven Malaysian HSR stations, and the typical station features and layout. More than 130 booths were set up at key locations along the alignment between Kuala Lumpur and Iskandar Puteri, said MyHSR Corp. “By locating them in high-traffic areas, our team on site were able to gather pertinent insights on how to further improve the project. It is also our goal to continuously engage the public to share updates on the project,” said Chief Executive Officer Mohd Nur Ismal Mohamed Kamal.

In a statement on Thursday (Feb 8), MyHSR Corp said the exercise that ended on Jan 31 received more than 35,000 responses, the highest amount of feedback among rail-based public transportation projects in Malaysia. About 95 per cent of feedback received from visitors and survey respondents were supportive of the HSR project, with 98 per cent of positive responses received from Kuala Lumpur and Johor. The exercise provided the public with the opportunity to view information about the project such as the planned alignment, locations of the seven Malaysian HSR stations, and the typical station features and layout.

In a three-page letter to Singapore\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday (Feb 2), the Colombian embassy expressed \"serious concern\", saying the eatery was paying tribute to the \"worst criminal in the history of Colombia\". \"The Embassy of the Republic of Colombia wants to share some information to refresh the horror that this criminal caused in Colombia ... not to mention the drug addiction he promoted and the war he declared,\" the letter said. \"If the idea of the owner was to make his or her business look profitable and trendy, it is inducing ... confusion, because Colombia is not what \'Narcos-Netflix\' portrays anymore.\" It said Colombia cannot \"tolerate any more tributes to that criminal.\" When AFP visited the restaurant in China Square Central along Cross Street on Tuesday evening, patrons occupied about a dozen tables having post-work drinks, seemingly unaware of the controversy. Advertisement Advertisement Several bouquets stood on stands by the door next to a decal of Escobar\'s face, congratulating the eatery on its recent opening. Owner Stan Sri Ganesh told AFP that he decided on the name \"simply because it had the word \'bar\' in it\". Several users have posted abusive comments and sent threatening messages to the gastropub\'s Facebook page, he said. \"It was meant to be a pun ... we never expected the abuse.\" Responding to critics on its Facebook page, the restaurant apologised and said that it plans to change its logo. \"We’re aware of the recent controversy concerning our branding and would like to take this opportunity to apologise to any community or individual who was offended by it,\" it wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. \"We would like to reiterate that it was never our intention to glorify or condone the actions of Pablo Escobar. \"Anyway, we heard you and we’re working on revamping our logo.\" More than two decades after police shot Escobar dead in his stronghold of Medellin, the cocaine cartel leader was immortalised in the hit Netflix series \"Narcos\". Escobar is still deeply popular in Medellin, where he is regarded as a saint and anti-hero souvenirs with his face on them do brisk business. Colombia has recently come out of a decades-long civil conflict fuelled by drug trafficking that claimed thousands of lives. The United Nations ranks Colombia as the world\'s biggest producer of coca, the raw material for the drug.

Fifty-three people were convicted of offences related to marriages of convenience in 2017 – a 23.3 per cent spike from the year before, ICA said in its annual statistics report. The report highlighted a particular case last year which led to the arrest of 12 people. In that case, officers were looking into a suspected sham marriage between a Singaporean man and his Vietnamese wife - but found five other such couples during the course of their investigations. These couples all involved Singaporean men and Vietnamese women, said the ICA. The men, aged between 24 and 57, entered into these marriages for money, while the women, who were aged between 23 and 34, wanted to prolong their stay in Singapore, according to the report. Ten were sentenced to jail terms ranging from six to 18 months, while court proceedings are ongoing for the remaining two.

It also noted that heavy commercial vehicles continued to be used for smuggling contraband last year, calling this a \"trend of concern\". The report highlighted a case in October last year, during which officers found 2,190 cartons and 202 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes concealed in the modified compartment of a fuel tank towed by a prime mover at Tuas Checkpoint. A fuel bowser towed by a prime mover found with duty-unpaid cigarettes.

As such, we urge the community to be alert and collaborate with us to keep Singapore safe and secure,\" he said. FEWER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARRESTED A total of 186 illegal immigrants were arrested last year, a 14.3 per cent drop from the 217 arrested in 2016. The number of overstayers arrested was 990, down 6.7 per cent from 1,061 the year before. The authority highlighted an incident in May last year, in which 12 Indonesian men aged between 18 and 41 were arrested for immigration offences and for peddling duty-unpaid cigarettes at Yew Tee Industrial Estate. Twelve Indonesian men were arrested over immigration offences and for peddling duty-unpaid cigarettes.

The number of harbourers of immigration offenders arrested declined by 17.6 per cent to 252 in 2017, from 306 in 2016. However, the number of employers of immigration offenders arrested increased by 6.7 per cent to 48 in 2017, from 45 in 2016.

U.S. skaters served up a shock by failing to pick up a single long-track medal despite sending a strong contingent to the Games in Sochi, and their skin suit maker Under Armour bore the brunt of the fallout for that failure. The chief complaint was that athletes were not allowed to get used to the suits before the Olympics, while fingers were also pointed at the design, which included a vent in the back that skaters said slowed them down by creating a vacuum. Rather than part ways with U.S. Speed Skating after the deluge of bad press, Under Armour doubled down and has worked closely with the team that landed in South Korea to ensure a repeat is not on the cards. \"First off it was super tight,\" Mitch Whitmore, who raced in the old skin suit and finished 27th in the 500 metres at the Sochi Games, told reporters in Pyeongchang on Thursday. \"Second, we only put it on like two weeks before the races started. It was really heavy, it just didn\'t stretch at all, also the vent on the back wasn\'t great. Advertisement Advertisement \"But we\'ve changed all of that. Our suit is really light, it stretches, it fits awesome, it looks cool. I think Under Armour and our coaching staff have done it all.\" In the world of speed skating, the difference between success and failure can come down to hundredths of a second, so having the right kind of aerodynamic skin suit technology on your side is essential. Millions of dollars are invested between each Olympic cycle to test suits in wind tunnels and design innovations are closely guarded from competing nations until as close to the Olympics as possible. \"Ultimately long track is a huge mental sport,\" said Joey Mantia, who will represent the United States in the 1,000m, 1,500m, mass start and team pursuit. \"If you believe in what you\'re racing in that\'s a big step in the right direction. I think we\'re all really happy with where the suits are and that\'s not going to be a factor this Games.\" The U.S. went back to the drawing board after Sochi, and arrive in South Korea with several novel methods designed to help the team, including using tai chi instructor Mark Cheng to help them recover after training sessions. \"Most of it is stuff that we already think about but he\'s a good instructor for mindfulness and just tai chi in general, going through the movements and loosening up our bodies,\" said Whitmore, who will race the 500m and 1,000m in Korea. Tai chi and spending much more time training on the ice than they did before Sochi has left the team in good spirits, and with the belief they can win at least five medals at the Gangneung Oval. \"Basically our staff has handed us all of the tools that we need to get medals, it\'s just up to us now,\" Mantia said. \"If we perform, we perform.

Abdulla Yameen left out key regional power India, which, along with the United States, Britain and the United Nations, has condemned the imposition of emergency and the arrest of top judges whose ruling against Yameen touched off new instability. The Maldives, best known for luxury tourist resorts, has become another arena of contest for India and China after it signed up to Beijing\'s Belt and Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond. India, which has had longstanding political and security ties to the islands about 400 km (250 miles) away, has sought to push back against China\'s expanding presence in the country of 400,000 people, most of them Muslims. Since the crisis erupted, Maldivian opposition leaders have urged New Delhi to intervene. Yameen sent his economic development minister, Mohamed Saeed, to China, the foreign minister, Mohamed Asim, to Pakistan and farming and fisheries minister Mohamed Shainee to Saudi Arabia, according to a posting on his website late on Wednesday. \"Members of the cabinet, on the direction of President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, will visit friendly nations of the Maldives and provide updates on the current situation,\" it added. Advertisement Advertisement The government wanted to send a special envoy to India as well, but the dates were not suitable for the Indian foreign ministry, said Ahmed Mohamed, the Maldives\' ambassador to India. The Maldives has been in crisis since last week, when the Supreme Court quashed convictions ranging from corruption to terrorism of nine opposition figures, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader. Tension came to a head when Yameen\'s government rejected the ruling, imposed the emergency for 15 days on Monday and then arrested the chief justice and another judge of the court. Nasheed, in exile since he was allowed to go abroad for medical treatment in 2016, urged India to send an envoy \"backed by the military\" to the Maldives to free the detained judges and political prisoners. India sent soldiers to foil a coup against the government in 1988, but has since refrained from getting directly involved in the country\'s unstable politics. Experts say it is more likely to put diplomatic, and even economic, pressure on the Yameen government than send its military. China has warned against outside powers meddling in the affairs of the tiny archipelago and on Thursday rejected Nasheed\'s criticism of its economic involvement. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China\'s aid to the Maldives had never carried political conditions. \"You also certainly can\'t talk about threatening the security of the Indian Ocean region,\" he said in response to an article by Nasheed in an Indian newspaper, slamming China for a \"land grab\" of the islands, and threatening regional security. Cooperation between China and the Maldives is for all the people of the islands and accords with the interests of both countries and both peoples, Geng added.

Abdulla Yameen left out key regional power India, which, along with the United States, Britain and the United Nations, has condemned the imposition of emergency and the arrest of top judges whose ruling against Yameen touched off new instability. The Maldives, best known for luxury tourist resorts, has become another arena of contest for India and China after it signed up to Beijing\'s Belt and Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond. India, which has had longstanding political and security ties to the islands about 400 km (250 miles) away, has sought to push back against China\'s expanding presence in the country of 400,000 people, most of them Muslims. Since the crisis erupted, Maldivian opposition leaders have urged New Delhi to intervene. Yameen sent his economic development minister, Mohamed Saeed, to China, the foreign minister, Mohamed Asim, to Pakistan and farming and fisheries minister Mohamed Shainee to Saudi Arabia, according to a posting on his website late on Wednesday. \"Members of the cabinet, on the direction of President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, will visit friendly nations of the Maldives and provide updates on the current situation,\" it added.

The ANC had scheduled a meeting on Wednesday evening of its National Executive Committee (NEC), which has the authority to fire Zuma, but cancelled it late on Tuesday after \"constructive\" talks between new ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa and Zuma. Ramaphosa said on Wednesday he was holding direct talks with Zuma over a transition of power and he hoped to conclude their discussions \"in coming days.\" But leaked comments from senior ANC official Paul Mashatile suggested that at the weekend Zuma was digging in. Mashatile was part of a group of the ANC\'s top six most powerful officials who met Zuma late on Sunday at his official residence in Pretoria in a bid to convince him to resign. \"Zuma basically said to us: \'I\'m not going anywhere. I\'m not convinced by you guys so I\'m not going to resign,\" Mashatile told investors at a mining conference in Cape Town on Tuesday. His comments emerged in a recording leaked to several domestic media outlets late on Wednesday. \"Our view is that if the president doesn\'t want to resign, for whatever reason, we have a party to run that is going to be very soon in the election campaign,\" Mashatile said. \"We want to ensure that we are not involved in motions of no-confidence, or impeachment that will affect our party.\" Advertisement Advertisement Mashatile was not immediately available for comment and an ANC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. South Africa holds elections next year and ANC leaders worry Zuma\'s tenure, which has included corruption scandals and an economic slowdown, could help it lose a majority it has held since the end of apartheid in 1994. Zuma took power in 2009 but has been in a weakened position since Ramaphosa replaced him as ANC leader in December. Zuma has survived several no-confidence votes in parliament but faces another on Feb. 22 filed by the far-left opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters. ANC officials say they want Zuma to resign rather than be forced out by a vote of the ANC\'s executive committee, or a parliamentary no-confidence vote, either of which could expose divisions in the party.

Le Monde, quoting anonymous AU sources, reported last month that data from computers in the Chinese-built building had been transferred nightly to Chinese servers for five years. After the massive hack was discovered a year ago, the building\'s IT system including servers was changed, according to Le Monde. During a sweep for bugs after the discovery, microphones hidden in desks and the walls were also detected and removed, the newspaper reported. Speaking to reporters with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at his side, head of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat said the allegations in the paper were false. \"What I can assure you of is that the relations between China and Africa, as I described, are unwavering. No manoeuvres of this type can distract us from our objectives,\" Faki said. \"The African Union is an international political organisation. It doesn\'t process secret defence dossiers. We are an administration and I don\'t see what interest there is to China to offer up a building of this type and then to spy,\" he said. Advertisement Advertisement \"So these are totally false allegations and I believe that we are completely disregarding them.\" The US$200 million headquarters was fully funded and built by China and opened to great fanfare in 2012. It was seen as a symbol of Beijing\'s thrust for influence in Africa, and access to the continent\'s natural resources. Wang said that he appreciated Faki\'s comments, and called the headquarters a symbol of China-Africa friendship. \"It cannot be tarnished by any person or any force,\" Wang said. China-Africa relations had withstood decades of ups and downs and changes in the international arena, he added. \"Perhaps some people or forces are unwilling to help Africa themselves and have a feeling of sour grapes about the achievements of China\'s cooperation with Africa,\" Wang said. \"Any rumours are powerless, and any sowing of discord won\'t succeed.\" As in the Ethiopian capital, China\'s investments in road and rail infrastructure are highly visible across the continent. At a 2015 summit in South Africa, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged US$60 billion (£43.3 billion) in aid and investment to the continent, saying it would continue to build roads, railways and ports.

The packet of instant coffee was found in a trash bin and given to the two men, said Dr S Subramaniam. “We leave it to the police to conduct a full investigation into this matter, it is now beyond the ministry’s jurisdiction. However monitoring will continue to be done from time to time,” the health minister added. Late last month, five people were admitted to a Penang hospital after consuming the durian white coffee. Two more were warded on Feb 4, complaining of dizziness and vomiting after drinking the coffee. Malaysian police had said they found a substance believed to be drugs inside sachets of the instant drink, and the health minister ordered random samples to be taken. However, he said there was no need to follow Singapore in removing the product off the shelves as the packets seemed to have been tampered with after leaving the factory. Advertisement Advertisement \"None of the people who\'ve taken this coffee actually bought it in the shop,\" Dr Subramaniam said on Monday. \"It\'s either given by individuals, picked up in garbage cans so there\'s something very fishy about this entire thing. So that\'s why we\'ve asked the police to investigate this thing thoroughly, whether there\'s an element of criminality in this whole thing.\" Manufacturer MyCafe had also said the packaging taken from one of the victims was tampered with as it appeared different from the original and was heavier than usual.

She had, against her will, given away her then two-day-old baby Wu Xue Ying nearly 39 years ago. The two embraced in an emotional reunion in August 2017 – their first meeting since Ms Wu was given up for adoption. “My daughter, I have wronged you. I am so sorry. My daughter, have you suffered much?” wailed Mdm Shen. “I’ve cried so many tears for you. I’ve been searching for so long and have been so heartbroken.” Seeing her lost daughter in the flesh after so many years, the older woman could not stop caressing her child’s face and wouldn’t let her go, overwhelmed with feelings of both relief and guilt. Advertisement Advertisement “I am responsible for sending her away. I have done her so much wrong,” she said brokenly. “After we sent her away, I could not sleep that night. I quarrelled vehemently with my husband. I asked him to retrieve her, but he said we could not afford it.” Under China’s then newly-implemented one-child policy - which mandated that couples could only have one child because of the rapid population growth – Mdm Shen and her husband had to give up one of their four kids. As the couple told the investigative programme Get Real, defying the law and keeping their youngest would have cost them their jobs and taken away their only means of survival in their village in Jiangsu Province, north of Shanghai. Mdm Shen vividly recalls the day she gave her baby away – she had dressed her in a rabbit sweater and a cotton jacket, with a piece of paper with her birth details carefully tucked inside her clothes. “My husband brought her to a bridge and passed her to the middlemen,” she recounted. “I wept and wept.” Defying the law would have cost Mdm Shen and her husband their livelihood. This family’s story is echoed across a country where at least half a million children – mostly girls - were abandoned by their parents or put up for adoption because of China\'s family planning policy, leaving families shattered and causing decades of pain. A very few rare and fortunate cases – like Mdm Shen and Ms Wu – have now found each other again, after years of searching and anguished wondering, thanks to the efforts of a volunteer group. Get Real documents the mission to such reunite families, and the miraculous, emotional result for some. (Watch the episode here.) DON\'T LET THE DOGS GET THEM Under the population control policy, China’s government imposed expensive fines on families who violated the limit, forcing women to choose between abortion or abandonment. The policy was eventually scrapped in 2015. Some parents who chose to abandon their kids left them in public places, such as bus stops, markets and government offices, in the hope that someone would pick them up. Mr Li Yong Guo, who is working to reunite such families, said: “After leaving their child at these places, the family members would not leave immediately, but hide at a distance to watch lest stray dogs or cats take the child away.” In 2011, Mr Li founded the volunteer group Jiangyin Relatives Tracing Association, to help the city’s elderly parents locate the children they had abandoned. In the past seven years, they have helped to reunite more than 100 families. But in a country of nearly 1.4 billion, finding one’s family is a formidable task, as he admitted: The probability of finding a match is similar to striking first prize in lottery. His team of 300 volunteers – many also searching for their own families - go online to reach out to children who believe their birth parents were from Jiangyin city. At the same time, hopeful parents sign up with the association through registration drives. Blood samples are collected, and DNA testing is used to link these parents and their children. Registration drive at which DNA samples are collected. The association holds these events every weekend during the summer holidays and has amassed a database of more than 2,000 old folks looking for their children. “If we do not organise these kinds of events, these people have no way to find their family,” explained Mr Li. A CHANCE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS For birth parents like Mdm Zhou Juying, the registration drives offer a glimmer of hope, and the chance to right the wrongs of the past. “Family planning officials came to my house and stayed for three days and nights. I did not want to give the child to them,” she recalled. “I try not to think too much, otherwise I will cry even more. I think about him all the time, wanting to get him back.” Zhou Xiao Yun, like many abandoned children now grown up, seek to close that circle in their lives. Teacher Zhou Xiao Yun has been searching for her birth parents for over 20 years. While she had very loving adoptive parents, her childhood was not easy, she said. I am especially sad during festivals. I wonder if my birth parents left an extra pair of chopsticks for me; just the thought of it pains my heart. A volunteer with the association, Ms Zhou recognises that many abandoned children, who are now adults like her, want to close that circle in their lives – to find out more about their roots, their surnames at birth, and where they were born. “What they most want to know, is why they were abandoned,” she said. “Some hate their parents and want to know why they were the ones who were given up instead of the other siblings.” WATCH: The faces of anguish - and a special reunion (5:03) ‘NO’ TO REUNION But not everyone is so keen to reconnect with their lost loved ones. Some birth parents fear being hated by the child they left behind, said volunteer Wang Zhou Li. Others are worried their existing children would object violently to their search. “They are afraid that if they find their abandoned child, their other children would stop supporting them financially. So they don’t even start looking,” said Ms Wang. Then there are the adoptive parents, some of whom resort to extreme measures to prevent reunions from happening, said fellow volunteer Ms Zhou. They move homes multiple times, or simply lie to their children that they were not adopted. “In the north, a lot of parents keep the child away from school, afraid that the child will take off and forget about them. If the children are illiterate, then they will remain farmers,” she said. You can’t leave because you can’t read – so you won’t be able to find your family. Ms Han Feng Ying from Handan city discovered the fact of her adoption when she was six from other children in her neighbourhood. Her adoptive father never spoke to her about it “He treated me like his own and probably did not want me to find my birth parents,” she said. SEARCH, OR REGRET FOREVER Fortunately for Ms Wu Xue Ying, her adoptive mother Mdm Yang Ai Yun did not stop her searching for her birth mother. This was despite the older woman’s constant fear that she might lose her adopted daughter once she found her roots. “If she visits me, then she cares. If not, then that reflects on her maturity,” said a teary Mdm Yang, who has two children of her own. Mdm Yang Ai Yun with her adoptive daughter. Ms Wu, 39, had sent her blood sample to the Jiangyin association from her home town in Anhui some 500km away. She hoped for a match but was aware that the odds were extremely low. “At this age, if I still don’t look for my birth parents, I may regret it forever,” she said. When she was seven, she found out from her classmates that she was adopted, and they refused to have anything to do with her after that. “They said I was … not my parents’ natural child. They belittled me and refused to play with me,” she said. For years, she kept her feelings of insecurity and unhappiness a secret. “On the outside, I come across as a cheerful person and someone who gives joy to others. But the pain I feel inside, no one knows,” she said. Ms Wu Xue Ying was plagued by insecurities She was one of the lucky ones – three months after she sent in her blood sample, her wait finally came to an end. She received news from Mr Li that her sample matched that of a couple in their records. “I didn’t believe it. My mind was a complete blank. I was frozen and I thought I was dreaming,” she said. “I was extremely excited, so much that I secretly cried.” MORE WORK AHEAD During the emotional meeting with her birth parents, Ms Wu comforted her guilt-ridden birth mother as Mdm Shen repeatedly apologised. “I don’t blame you, it was a long time ago. Living conditions were hard or you wouldn’t have given me away,” Ms Wu told her, assuring her that she felt no resentment. Ms Wu and Mdm Shen, reunited. She now has two families – but there’s no fairy tale ending for her yet, as she has to tread carefully between the two, so as not to upset one side or the other. Her anxious adoptive mother and brother are still trying to come to terms with the new situation. “Even now, they when I try to talk to them about it, they will cry,” she said. She reassured them that she had no plans to move away to live with her birth family. On her part, Mdm Shen missed her new-found daughter greatly after Ms Wu returned to her hometown. “I can’t bear to be parted from her, so far away in Anhui,” she said. “But I’m still really elated. Being able to reunite with my daughter, my life is now complete.” Mr Li Yong Guo, founder of the Jiangyin Relatives Tracing Association The efforts of one volunteer group has transformed the lives of these women – but in the Jiangyin association’s DNA database, there are still 3,000 seekers waiting for their own happy ending. For Mr Li, the feeling of successfully reuniting a family is indescribable. “Seeking relatives after many years of separation and reuniting them is no simple feat,” he said. “I hope we will continue to have such positive results, even surpass what we have already accomplished.” Watch this episode of Get Real here.

My daughter, have you suffered much?” wailed Mdm Shen. “I’ve cried so many tears for you. I’ve been searching for so long and have been so heartbroken.” Seeing her lost daughter in the flesh after so many years, the older woman could not stop caressing her child’s face and wouldn’t let her go, overwhelmed with feelings of both relief and guilt. Advertisement Advertisement “I am responsible for sending her away. I have done her so much wrong,” she said brokenly. “After we sent her away, I could not sleep that night. I quarrelled vehemently with my husband. I asked him to retrieve her, but he said we could not afford it.” Under China’s then newly-implemented one-child policy - which mandated that couples could only have one child because of the rapid population growth – Mdm Shen and her husband had to give up one of their four kids. As the couple told the investigative programme Get Real, defying the law and keeping their youngest would have cost them their jobs and taken away their only means of survival in their village in Jiangsu Province, north of Shanghai. Mdm Shen vividly recalls the day she gave her baby away – she had dressed her in a rabbit sweater and a cotton jacket, with a piece of paper with her birth details carefully tucked inside her clothes. “My husband brought her to a bridge and passed her to the middlemen,” she recounted. “I wept and wept.” Defying the law would have cost Mdm Shen and her husband their livelihood. This family’s story is echoed across a country where at least half a million children – mostly girls - were abandoned by their parents or put up for adoption because of China\'s family planning policy, leaving families shattered and causing decades of pain. A very few rare and fortunate cases – like Mdm Shen and Ms Wu – have now found each other again, after years of searching and anguished wondering, thanks to the efforts of a volunteer group. Get Real documents the mission to such reunite families, and the miraculous, emotional result for some. (Watch the episode here.) DON\'T LET THE DOGS GET THEM Under the population control policy, China’s government imposed expensive fines on families who violated the limit, forcing women to choose between abortion or abandonment. The policy was eventually scrapped in 2015. Some parents who chose to abandon their kids left them in public places, such as bus stops, markets and government offices, in the hope that someone would pick them up. Mr Li Yong Guo, who is working to reunite such families, said: “After leaving their child at these places, the family members would not leave immediately, but hide at a distance to watch lest stray dogs or cats take the child away.” In 2011, Mr Li founded the volunteer group Jiangyin Relatives Tracing Association, to help the city’s elderly parents locate the children they had abandoned. In the past seven years, they have helped to reunite more than 100 families. But in a country of nearly 1.4 billion, finding one’s family is a formidable task, as he admitted: The probability of finding a match is similar to striking first prize in lottery. His team of 300 volunteers – many also searching for their own families - go online to reach out to children who believe their birth parents were from Jiangyin city. At the same time, hopeful parents sign up with the association through registration drives. Blood samples are collected, and DNA testing is used to link these parents and their children. Registration drive at which DNA samples are collected. The association holds these events every weekend during the summer holidays and has amassed a database of more than 2,000 old folks looking for their children. “If we do not organise these kinds of events, these people have no way to find their family,” explained Mr Li. A CHANCE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS For birth parents like Mdm Zhou Juying, the registration drives offer a glimmer of hope, and the chance to right the wrongs of the past. “Family planning officials came to my house and stayed for three days and nights. I did not want to give the child to them,” she recalled. “I try not to think too much, otherwise I will cry even more. I think about him all the time, wanting to get him back.” Zhou Xiao Yun, like many abandoned children now grown up, seek to close that circle in their lives. Teacher Zhou Xiao Yun has been searching for her birth parents for over 20 years. While she had very loving adoptive parents, her childhood was not easy, she said. I am especially sad during festivals. I wonder if my birth parents left an extra pair of chopsticks for me; just the thought of it pains my heart. A volunteer with the association, Ms Zhou recognises that many abandoned children, who are now adults like her, want to close that circle in their lives – to find out more about their roots, their surnames at birth, and where they were born. “What they most want to know, is why they were abandoned,” she said. “Some hate their parents and want to know why they were the ones who were given up instead of the other siblings.” WATCH: The faces of anguish - and a special reunion (5:03) ‘NO’ TO REUNION But not everyone is so keen to reconnect with their lost loved ones. Some birth parents fear being hated by the child they left behind, said volunteer Wang Zhou Li. Others are worried their existing children would object violently to their search. “They are afraid that if they find their abandoned child, their other children would stop supporting them financially. So they don’t even start looking,” said Ms Wang. Then there are the adoptive parents, some of whom resort to extreme measures to prevent reunions from happening, said fellow volunteer Ms Zhou. They move homes multiple times, or simply lie to their children that they were not adopted. “In the north, a lot of parents keep the child away from school, afraid that the child will take off and forget about them. If the children are illiterate, then they will remain farmers,” she said. You can’t leave because you can’t read – so you won’t be able to find your family. Ms Han Feng Ying from Handan city discovered the fact of her adoption when she was six from other children in her neighbourhood. Her adoptive father never spoke to her about it “He treated me like his own and probably did not want me to find my birth parents,” she said. SEARCH, OR REGRET FOREVER Fortunately for Ms Wu Xue Ying, her adoptive mother Mdm Yang Ai Yun did not stop her searching for her birth mother. This was despite the older woman’s constant fear that she might lose her adopted daughter once she found her roots. “If she visits me, then she cares. If not, then that reflects on her maturity,” said a teary Mdm Yang, who has two children of her own. Mdm Yang Ai Yun with her adoptive daughter. Ms Wu, 39, had sent her blood sample to the Jiangyin association from her home town in Anhui some 500km away. She hoped for a match but was aware that the odds were extremely low. “At this age, if I still don’t look for my birth parents, I may regret it forever,” she said. When she was seven, she found out from her classmates that she was adopted, and they refused to have anything to do with her after that. “They said I was … not my parents’ natural child. They belittled me and refused to play with me,” she said. For years, she kept her feelings of insecurity and unhappiness a secret. “On the outside, I come across as a cheerful person and someone who gives joy to others. But the pain I feel inside, no one knows,” she said. Ms Wu Xue Ying was plagued by insecurities She was one of the lucky ones – three months after she sent in her blood sample, her wait finally came to an end. She received news from Mr Li that her sample matched that of a couple in their records. “I didn’t believe it. My mind was a complete blank. I was frozen and I thought I was dreaming,” she said. “I was extremely excited, so much that I secretly cried.” MORE WORK AHEAD During the emotional meeting with her birth parents, Ms Wu comforted her guilt-ridden birth mother as Mdm Shen repeatedly apologised. “I don’t blame you, it was a long time ago. Living conditions were hard or you wouldn’t have given me away,” Ms Wu told her, assuring her that she felt no resentment. Ms Wu and Mdm Shen, reunited. She now has two families – but there’s no fairy tale ending for her yet, as she has to tread carefully between the two, so as not to upset one side or the other. Her anxious adoptive mother and brother are still trying to come to terms with the new situation. “Even now, they when I try to talk to them about it, they will cry,” she said. She reassured them that she had no plans to move away to live with her birth family. On her part, Mdm Shen missed her new-found daughter greatly after Ms Wu returned to her hometown. “I can’t bear to be parted from her, so far away in Anhui,” she said. “But I’m still really elated. Being able to reunite with my daughter, my life is now complete.” Mr Li Yong Guo, founder of the Jiangyin Relatives Tracing Association The efforts of one volunteer group has transformed the lives of these women – but in the Jiangyin association’s DNA database, there are still 3,000 seekers waiting for their own happy ending. For Mr Li, the feeling of successfully reuniting a family is indescribable. “Seeking relatives after many years of separation and reuniting them is no simple feat,” he said. “I hope we will continue to have such positive results, even surpass what we have already accomplished.” Watch this episode of Get Real here.

It’s the same for this cat robot,” said Ms Nakagawa, who has devoted her life to the robotics industry. “(But) if this robot had a human-like appearance, you’d (expect) that it behaves like a human, for example, to speak very cleverly and (function) very well.” Advertisement Advertisement Japan has long been at the forefront of robotics - it has the most robots in the world and is set to invest ¥100 billion (S$1.2 billion) in robotics research. In 10 to 20 years’ time, half of the country’s working population could be replaced by robots or artificial intelligence programmes. And if the ones that can move and think like humans are going to do a lot more of Japan’s jobs, what will they look like? While people may think these are personal choices, the programme Why It Matters discovers that robot appearances are built based on common biases, as people have specific ideas about how their robot replacements should look like. They may be human-like, male or female, or even animal-like. (Watch the episode here.) DINOSAURS MANNING THE COUNTER For example, at Tokyo’s Henn-na Hotel, the world’s first robot-run hotel – with the largest concentration of robots in a single hotel – guests are checked in by teeth-baring velociraptor robots manning the front desk. Receptionist and robot resource manager Saki Kato - one of the few human staff at the facility - spoke about the need to have robots as co-workers as the population and the number of working adults in Japan decreases. She also suggested that guests’ responses to the dinosaur robots have been largely positive. “The raptors are more popular than the humanoid,” she said. “We’re humans, and we see humans every day. We’ve never seen real dinosaurs … Everyone loves dinosaurs.” Except maybe the children. “When the automated doors open, the children cry when they see the Tyrannosaurus rex robot. Some even said they’d rather stay outside the hotel,” she laughed. Still, some roboticists think robots need not look like humans to bridge the gap between man and machine. This is because of the Uncanny Valley, a concept coined by roboticist Masahiro Mori. He held that as robots become almost human-like, people develop a sense of unease about them, but that their feelings change if the robot is exactly like a human. WATCH: Robots in action (2:31) THE MORE HUMAN, THE BETTER? Mr Takashi Minato, one of the programmers at the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory in Osaka University, the leading robot laboratory in Japan, thinks it is important for a robot communicating with humans to look like one too. “You can’t have a natural conversation with a speaker or a smartphone … A human-like appearance results in a different experience in the conversation,” he said. One of the lab’s most impressive robots is Erica, a humanoid that is able to engage people in conversation. It speaks in a synthesised voice, can make various facial expressions and gestures like a person. You can hold a conversation with Erica Erica can be put to work as a receptionist at a hotel or hospital or even as an English teacher. “In a conversation between two humans, we get a lot of information from the person’s gaze, expressions or gestures,” said Mr Minato. “Robots like Erica are a kind of bridge between humans and devices.” Over in Singapore, Professor Nadia Magnenat Thalmann, the director of the Institute for Media Innovation at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), would rather interact with a human-like robot than any random-shaped one. One of her creations is social robot Nadine, made in her likeness. It was developed in 2015 as part of a project to address manpower needs in the administrative and healthcare sectors. “If we need partners in life to help us … it’s very important that they look like humans and function exactly like humans,” said Prof Thalmann. Watch: Nadine in action (1:27) GENDER STEREOTYPES IN ROBOTS For Professor Tatsuya Nomura from Ryukoku University’s Department of Media Informatics, the bigger problem is not the debate about how human robots should look; it is about the gender stereotyping of robots. Having spent decades studying the relationship between man and machines, he believes that the assignment of gender to robots is a controversial issue because it may produce gender stereotypes. (Japanese) have a stereotype that receptionists should be female … But receptionists needn’t be female. \"A male can also conduct the tasks of a receptionist,” he said. “This type of gender stereotype can cause similar problems in every country.” Should robot receptionists be only female? “Some robotics designers use these gender stereotypes (when they design robots) in order to smoothen the interaction between humans and robots. This is because these gender stereotypes reduce our communicative burdens,” he noted. In other words, making robots human-like and gendered could trap men and women in the stereotypical roles from which these robots could free them. In Singapore, the lifelike Nadine is now working as a receptionist in NTU. When asked if this reinforces gender stereotypes, Prof Thalmann said receptionists are women in most cases, but that a male receptionist robot should perhaps be made next. “We should educate people. We should take this opportunity to have maybe mostly female security guard robots,” she added. “We should just make the contrary of (what) it is today … Then people get educated. It’s also a way to change the stereotypes and not continue them.” Watch this episode of Why It Matters here. Professor Nadia Magnenat Thalmann and robot receptionist Nadine.

Not only does she recognise the people she meets, she also remembers past conversations. Come this Saturday (Jun 25), the life-like socially intelligent robot, who has been making waves around the world, is set to start work as a receptionist at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Institute of Media Innovation. What is significant about this moment is that it could herald a future where social robots like her take on certain jobs once thought do-able only by humans. The 1.7m tall Nadine was created by a team of scientists headed by Professor Nadia Thalmann, director of the Institute of Media Innovation. Nadine is a ground-breaking project developed to address manpower needs in the administrative and healthcare sectors – for instance, assisting the elderly at home, when caregivers are in short supply. Said Prof Thalmann, in an interview with current affairs programme Talking Point: “If you have a Nadine companion that can help you, give you medication, call others for you, it’s a dream.” “BETTER THAN A STANDARD RECEPTIONIST” Advertisement Advertisement But the advent of a social robot like Nadine – who can express moods and emotions, and interact and communicate with humans to a degree that robots have not previously – also poses a challenge to human employees and future job-seekers. Seen by some in the field as the epitome of artificial intelligence, Nadine grasps things quickly, acts in response to the situation and is programmed to work efficiently for long hours. As a receptionist, “she can say goodbye and good morning, and keep a list of what to do. She will take documents we hand to her, read them and, being a computer, keep it filed. She will do it perfectly, and better than a standard receptionist,” said Prof Thalmann, on whom Nadine\'s looks are modelled. There are other robots that can also assist in more complex professions, such as law and journalism, said the professor. Acting as a huge database, such robots could answer standard questions and aid journalists in understanding texts or sorting out information. They could help lawyers retrieve past cases efficiently and apply specific laws to specific cases, she noted. Watch: Nadine in action (1:27) ARE HUMANS IN DANGER OF BEING REPLACED? But could robots one day take over the jobs of lawyers and journalists? Just how concerned should humans be about being replaced by the likes of Nadine? Prof Thalmann reckons it could be a matter of “five, 10 years” for robots to effectively take over repetitive jobs as receptionists, restaurant cleaners or drivers (in the form of self-driving cars). Anything beyond 10 years, however, is difficult to predict – will robots become capable of coming up with unique ideas, or more subtle decision-making? “It is difficult for now at least,” she said. What observers believe that is that today’s emerging technology will not permanently displace most of the workforce, so much as shift the jobs into other sectors. Mr Aziz Amirali Merchant, a member of the Future of Manufacturing Steering Committee, said human talent is needed “to drive and grow the robotic workforce, to design, develop, manufacture, train, maintain and repair these robots”. This, he said, is where STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) training is important - and by focusing on it, “a new workforce will be created and this could provide very good paying jobs for Singaporeans”. Prof Thalmann’s view is that the Government should train people for “other kinds of jobs where the robots are not there”. She likened to it to how when computers came on the scene, many jobs were lost, yet “without the computer, we would be lost”. 3D printing is another development that has made some work obsolete. “So you see,” she added, “we cannot stop these kinds of know-how. The question is, how can we give the background, the knowledge to people so they can serve in another sector where we need them.” Talking Point explores the issue of PME unemployment on Thursday, June 23, at 9.30pm on MediaCorp Channel 5.

She has been rushed to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times over the past two years. She is three years old. Xie Xinlin was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare genetic disease that causes muscles to weaken progressively. It is incurable. When she falls ill with a simple cough and cold, she finds it very hard to breathe, and her body reacts severely. That is when she goes to the ICU, needing a ventilator to pump air into her lungs. Each time, she is at risk of never returning home. What do Xinlin and her parents go through in the ICU, behind those closed doors? For the first time, their story and that of other families can be told by Channel NewsAsia, which gained unprecedented access to Singapore’s largest children’s ICU, at the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH). Xie Xinlin, aged 3, has been in and out of the ICU many times. Advertisement Advertisement From long, lonely waits to risky medical procedures, moments of pain, love and heartbreak – the five-part series Inside the Children\'s ICU documented the children’s struggle to survive, and the work of the doctors who fought to give them the chance to grow up. PADDLING FURIOUSLY, WITH NO ROOM FOR ERROR For about two months, the cameras captured the team of more than 20 doctors and nurses working together to provide critical care for the children, cope with emergencies, deal with distraught parents, and try to save those on the brink of death. (Watch the first episode here.) How did they, together with the parents, make tough decisions, including those life-and-death ones? In the words of senior consultant Mok Yee Hui, who now heads the KKH Children’s ICU, they must remain calm above all else, “even if (their) feet are paddling furiously underwater” in the “high-intensity, dynamic (and) fast-paced environment”. But that is easier said than done, as there is no room for mistakes. Children’s ICU senior resident Sudipta Roy Chowdhury. For Children’s ICU senior resident Sudipta Roy Chowdhury, it did not take long – her first week – to get called into action on a challenging case. The patient was another three-year-old, Mohd Haris Dzulkarnein, whom she had to transfer to KKH. Haris was fine the day before he went into hospital. Then he had a fever suddenly, and overnight, he was suffocating. He was first rushed to another hospital, where his father, coincidentally, was about to undergo a heart procedure. Mr Buang Taib recalled: “I rushed down. I pulled out all my tubes. The doctors said I couldn’t go, but I said, ‘No, my son is in the emergency unit now.’” Mr Buang Taib and his son, Haris. But his son needed to be transferred to Singapore’s most advanced children’s ICU, at KKH. The hospital runs a Children Hospital Emergency Transport Service which, when activated, will send an ICU team to other hospitals to pick up children who need critical care. Dr Chowdhury, a paediatrician-in-training, said of Haris\' case: “We thought initially it could have been due to pneumonia or some form of asthma exacerbation, because he has a history of asthma.\" But then his blood pressure also dropped, \"causing his organs to start failing – his liver, his kidneys”. The medical professionals found themselves in a race against time to discover why. At one point, they were concerned his brain might get damaged. The case of Mohd Haris Dzulkarnein, aged 3, baffled doctors at first. LOOKING AFTER THE PARENTS AS WELL Situations like these are “a different ball game” from Dr Chowdhury’s previous neonatal posting, during which she dealt with premature babies. The first week of her three-month-long clinical rotation with the Children’s ICU was “very challenging”, she said, adding: “(To) a lot of the patients here, we’re like the gatekeepers sometimes … the last line (of defence) in this hospital.” This ICU team of doctors and nurses work round the clock to care for up to 16 critically ill children. Unlike other nurses who have five patients, the nurses here are in charge of only one or two children each - because of the close supervision and advanced life support needed for their life-threatening conditions. And the nurses do not tend only to the children. Assistant nurse clinician Annabelle Zhang said: “Parents tend to be very stressed out and very anxious. We need to always be with them to provide them with reassurance.” Within the Children’s ICU, most families are also assigned a social worker immediately to help them cope with the stress of having their child admitted. Dr Mok said: “We can’t take away the fact that their loved ones are critically ill. But our team does understand that this is very overwhelming. So we try very hard to support the families and the patients, and try to make it as positive an experience … as possible. Sometimes that is as much a challenge as the search for answers to the medical problems. As the team investigated the cause of Haris’ failing health, his father was at the bedside of his unresponsive son, lamenting to himself: “Why not me? Why my son?” WATCH: What does it take to work in the CICU? (4:59) NO EASY DECISIONS Haris’ case is not the kind usually seen in the ICU. Many of its children are those who return frequently to the hospital – such as Aulia Sofea Arwin, who was back for a medical procedure a month after being discharged. Now three, she was diagnosed with childhood leukaemia at age two. She returned for an operation to get her central line – a tube inserted into one of her large veins, for medicine to be delivered – replaced. An infection had contaminated the original line, and after four rounds of chemotherapy in the past year, Aulia’s immune system was vulnerable. The ICU doctors managed to keep her bloodstream infection at bay with a cocktail of antibiotics. But before her condition could stabilise, the cut in her anus, which had caused her infection, threatened to deal her another blow, as it had not healed, The doctors had to resolve whether to escalate intervention by creating a stoma bag to collect stools from her intestines. But that would require a major surgery - and Aulia’s parents had to decide whether to do nothing, or accept the risks of the procedure in a bid to speed up the healing process. At one point, mother Shikin Rahman told her only child, who had spent two weeks in the ICU already: “You’ve been fighting all along, right? So you have to fight some more ... You cannot lose hope okay?” STAYING CALM, WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE The decisions do not get any easier when parents defer to the doctors, for example in the case of nine-year-old Marcus. One minute he was on a football field, the next he was in an ambulance with intense chest pains and his heart rhythm out of whack. A day after being admitted to the ICU, his blood pressure dropped drastically. This and his erratic heartbeat were warning signs that he was in danger of multiple organ failure. “His heart function was deteriorating in front of our eyes, to a point that the heart was hardly moving,” said Dr Mok. Five different machines are (sounding the alarm) … two nurses are calling you, one doctor is saying something … It’s challenging to remain calm and continue to function effectively when all hell breaks loose. The doctors had to decide quickly whether to put Marcus through a high-risk procedure: Hooking him up to a heart-lung bypass machine. Before they made the call, they spoke to his mother Sheran. She said: “The moment (they) … told me his blood pressure has gone down, and he has to be moved to be supported by (the machine), that was already telling me that, oh my God, there’s a high chance I’d lose him.” But the machine kept Marcus alive, pumping blood around his body. Nobody could tell, however, when or even whether his heart function would return. “There’s nothing I can do other than just pray that he’ll come back,\" said his mother. THE QUESTION OF WHEN TO LET GO What happens, though, when a parent knows there is no cure for his child? Mr Xie Ding Shan had brought his daughter Xinlin to the ICU a few times already. Once again, she was put on a ventilator for oxygen and a machine to help her cough out secretions such as mucus blocking her airways. “The next flu or cough – we don’t know when she’ll get it – and she has to go through this again,” said Mr Xie. “So to me and my wife, it’s painful to see her suffer.” They were told that Xinlin seemed to be weaker than before. The longer she was on the ventilator, the faster her muscles would deteriorate. But nobody knew if she would survive the “extubation” (being removed from the ventilator). Mr Xie said: “In case Xinlin can’t sustain (her breathing) or this extubation isn’t successful, it may be time for us to let her go.” There was once when a younger Dr Mok would have had a strong urge to intervene on her patients’ behalf. But the hardest lesson she has learnt working in the ICU is that technology and science are finite. “There are more things that we have no treatment for than things that we do have treatments for,” she said. As I advance in my career, it’s about the realisation of saying when enough is enough – when any further intervention is just going to cause more harm. Dr Chowdhury has also been learning how to better channel her emotions. “Death is quite commonplace in our profession. Some people think we get used to it; I don’t think we get used to it. I think we just have to know how to handle it,” she said. “You wonder if you could have done something more, of course … but I think you’ve got to have closure … You want to make sure you’re still prepared to make sure that the next patient walks away fine from the ICU.” Senior consultant Mok Yee Hui, who now heads the KKH Children’s ICU. THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT A different group of professionals found it difficult not to be emotionally affected: The Channel NewsAsia crew. “I was there when they thought Xinlin was going to die. Yes, I cried while filming. I was wearing a mask, and it was wet due to my tears,” said cameraman Mohamed Haffiz Abdul Aziz. “The family members requested the medical staff to loosen the tubes attached to her, as they wanted to carry her … They took turns carrying her in their arms, hugging and crying.” Xinlin\'s sister. The crew developed an attachment to the children, and some of them also gave the children presents. Mr Mohamed Haffiz, for example, bought Aulia a Minion doll wearing a Captain America outfit because she loved the Minions cartoon creatures. He said: “Her mum created an Instagram account for her with the frequent hashtag #lilfighter. Captain America is a superhero, and on that doll, there’s a big letter A, which can also (stand for) her name.” Producer Elrica Tanu found it a “very emotional experience” just being in the same room with the families when “difficult conversations were taking place”, let alone farewells. BEHIND THE SCENES The emotional roller-coaster was not the only challenge the crew faced. They also had to take care not to pass on any infections to the children and vice versa. So, for example, they had to wipe all their equipment with alcohol wipes every time on arrival. “Everywhere we moved around the wards, we’d always sanitise our hands,” added Mr Mohamed Haffiz “Due to the frequent contact with the hand sanitiser, the colour of my wedding ring kind of faded. But it’s okay. I’m fine with that.” To Ms Tanu, the most difficult challenge was getting the patients’ parents and the medical team to talk to the crew on camera “when they obviously have bigger things on their minds”. “It takes time and a lot of empathy to build trust and be able to obtain the kind of access we eventually had,” she said. “I learnt a lot about resilience from these families, and I’ve a lot of respect for the dedicated medical professionals who work day and night to save lives. “It\'s hard to see a child suffer. It\'s hard to see parents have to say goodbye to their child … Sometimes bad things happen to good people.” Watch the first episode of the five-part series Inside the Children’s ICU here.

In the words of senior consultant Mok Yee Hui, who now heads the KKH Children’s ICU, they must remain calm above all else, “even if (their) feet are paddling furiously underwater” in the “high-intensity, dynamic (and) fast-paced environment”. But that is easier said than done, as there is no room for mistakes. Children’s ICU senior resident Sudipta Roy Chowdhury. For Children’s ICU senior resident Sudipta Roy Chowdhury, it did not take long – her first week – to get called into action on a challenging case. The patient was another three-year-old, Mohd Haris Dzulkarnein, whom she had to transfer to KKH. Haris was fine the day before he went into hospital. Then he had a fever suddenly, and overnight, he was suffocating. He was first rushed to another hospital, where his father, coincidentally, was about to undergo a heart procedure. Mr Buang Taib recalled: “I rushed down. I pulled out all my tubes. The doctors said I couldn’t go, but I said, ‘No, my son is in the emergency unit now.’” Mr Buang Taib and his son, Haris. But his son needed to be transferred to Singapore’s most advanced children’s ICU, at KKH. The hospital runs a Children Hospital Emergency Transport Service which, when activated, will send an ICU team to other hospitals to pick up children who need critical care. Dr Chowdhury, a paediatrician-in-training, said of Haris\' case: “We thought initially it could have been due to pneumonia or some form of asthma exacerbation, because he has a history of asthma.\" But then his blood pressure also dropped, \"causing his organs to start failing – his liver, his kidneys”. The medical professionals found themselves in a race against time to discover why. At one point, they were concerned his brain might get damaged. The case of Mohd Haris Dzulkarnein, aged 3, baffled doctors at first. LOOKING AFTER THE PARENTS AS WELL Situations like these are “a different ball game” from Dr Chowdhury’s previous neonatal posting, during which she dealt with premature babies. The first week of her three-month-long clinical rotation with the Children’s ICU was “very challenging”, she said, adding: “(To) a lot of the patients here, we’re like the gatekeepers sometimes … the last line (of defence) in this hospital.” This ICU team of doctors and nurses work round the clock to care for up to 16 critically ill children. Unlike other nurses who have five patients, the nurses here are in charge of only one or two children each - because of the close supervision and advanced life support needed for their life-threatening conditions. And the nurses do not tend only to the children. Assistant nurse clinician Annabelle Zhang said: “Parents tend to be very stressed out and very anxious. We need to always be with them to provide them with reassurance.” Within the Children’s ICU, most families are also assigned a social worker immediately to help them cope with the stress of having their child admitted. Dr Mok said: “We can’t take away the fact that their loved ones are critically ill. But our team does understand that this is very overwhelming. So we try very hard to support the families and the patients, and try to make it as positive an experience … as possible. Sometimes that is as much a challenge as the search for answers to the medical problems. As the team investigated the cause of Haris’ failing health, his father was at the bedside of his unresponsive son, lamenting to himself: “Why not me? Why my son?” WATCH: What does it take to work in the CICU? (4:59) NO EASY DECISIONS Haris’ case is not the kind usually seen in the ICU. Many of its children are those who return frequently to the hospital – such as Aulia Sofea Arwin, who was back for a medical procedure a month after being discharged. Now three, she was diagnosed with childhood leukaemia at age two. She returned for an operation to get her central line – a tube inserted into one of her large veins, for medicine to be delivered – replaced. An infection had contaminated the original line, and after four rounds of chemotherapy in the past year, Aulia’s immune system was vulnerable. The ICU doctors managed to keep her bloodstream infection at bay with a cocktail of antibiotics. But before her condition could stabilise, the cut in her anus, which had caused her infection, threatened to deal her another blow, as it had not healed, The doctors had to resolve whether to escalate intervention by creating a stoma bag to collect stools from her intestines. But that would require a major surgery - and Aulia’s parents had to decide whether to do nothing, or accept the risks of the procedure in a bid to speed up the healing process. At one point, mother Shikin Rahman told her only child, who had spent two weeks in the ICU already: “You’ve been fighting all along, right? So you have to fight some more ... You cannot lose hope okay?” STAYING CALM, WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE The decisions do not get any easier when parents defer to the doctors, for example in the case of nine-year-old Marcus. One minute he was on a football field, the next he was in an ambulance with intense chest pains and his heart rhythm out of whack. A day after being admitted to the ICU, his blood pressure dropped drastically. This and his erratic heartbeat were warning signs that he was in danger of multiple organ failure. “His heart function was deteriorating in front of our eyes, to a point that the heart was hardly moving,” said Dr Mok. Five different machines are (sounding the alarm) … two nurses are calling you, one doctor is saying something … It’s challenging to remain calm and continue to function effectively when all hell breaks loose. The doctors had to decide quickly whether to put Marcus through a high-risk procedure: Hooking him up to a heart-lung bypass machine. Before they made the call, they spoke to his mother Sheran. She said: “The moment (they) … told me his blood pressure has gone down, and he has to be moved to be supported by (the machine), that was already telling me that, oh my God, there’s a high chance I’d lose him.” But the machine kept Marcus alive, pumping blood around his body. Nobody could tell, however, when or even whether his heart function would return. “There’s nothing I can do other than just pray that he’ll come back,\" said his mother. THE QUESTION OF WHEN TO LET GO What happens, though, when a parent knows there is no cure for his child? Mr Xie Ding Shan had brought his daughter Xinlin to the ICU a few times already. Once again, she was put on a ventilator for oxygen and a machine to help her cough out secretions such as mucus blocking her airways. “The next flu or cough – we don’t know when she’ll get it – and she has to go through this again,” said Mr Xie. “So to me and my wife, it’s painful to see her suffer.” They were told that Xinlin seemed to be weaker than before. The longer she was on the ventilator, the faster her muscles would deteriorate. But nobody knew if she would survive the “extubation” (being removed from the ventilator). Mr Xie said: “In case Xinlin can’t sustain (her breathing) or this extubation isn’t successful, it may be time for us to let her go.” There was once when a younger Dr Mok would have had a strong urge to intervene on her patients’ behalf. But the hardest lesson she has learnt working in the ICU is that technology and science are finite. “There are more things that we have no treatment for than things that we do have treatments for,” she said. As I advance in my career, it’s about the realisation of saying when enough is enough – when any further intervention is just going to cause more harm. Dr Chowdhury has also been learning how to better channel her emotions. “Death is quite commonplace in our profession. Some people think we get used to it; I don’t think we get used to it. I think we just have to know how to handle it,” she said. “You wonder if you could have done something more, of course … but I think you’ve got to have closure … You want to make sure you’re still prepared to make sure that the next patient walks away fine from the ICU.” Senior consultant Mok Yee Hui, who now heads the KKH Children’s ICU. THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT A different group of professionals found it difficult not to be emotionally affected: The Channel NewsAsia crew. “I was there when they thought Xinlin was going to die. Yes, I cried while filming. I was wearing a mask, and it was wet due to my tears,” said cameraman Mohamed Haffiz Abdul Aziz. “The family members requested the medical staff to loosen the tubes attached to her, as they wanted to carry her … They took turns carrying her in their arms, hugging and crying.” Xinlin\'s sister. The crew developed an attachment to the children, and some of them also gave the children presents. Mr Mohamed Haffiz, for example, bought Aulia a Minion doll wearing a Captain America outfit because she loved the Minions cartoon creatures. He said: “Her mum created an Instagram account for her with the frequent hashtag #lilfighter. Captain America is a superhero, and on that doll, there’s a big letter A, which can also (stand for) her name.” Producer Elrica Tanu found it a “very emotional experience” just being in the same room with the families when “difficult conversations were taking place”, let alone farewells. BEHIND THE SCENES The emotional roller-coaster was not the only challenge the crew faced. They also had to take care not to pass on any infections to the children and vice versa. So, for example, they had to wipe all their equipment with alcohol wipes every time on arrival. “Everywhere we moved around the wards, we’d always sanitise our hands,” added Mr Mohamed Haffiz “Due to the frequent contact with the hand sanitiser, the colour of my wedding ring kind of faded. But it’s okay. I’m fine with that.” To Ms Tanu, the most difficult challenge was getting the patients’ parents and the medical team to talk to the crew on camera “when they obviously have bigger things on their minds”. “It takes time and a lot of empathy to build trust and be able to obtain the kind of access we eventually had,” she said. “I learnt a lot about resilience from these families, and I’ve a lot of respect for the dedicated medical professionals who work day and night to save lives. “It\'s hard to see a child suffer. It\'s hard to see parents have to say goodbye to their child … Sometimes bad things happen to good people.” Watch the first episode of the five-part series Inside the Children’s ICU here.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday that he would not be able to say for certain if a leader could be chosen in six to nine months, which was the time frame suggested by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong in an earlier Facebook post. Giving his thoughts on the matter, Mr Ong, who is also the Second Minister for Defence, said: \"PM has said that it will need a while longer. I think it\'s useful. As our younger-generation ministers have said, we would select somebody to be the leader among us in good time.” “So I think it\'s good not to be constrained by six or nine months. We still need time to work together, know each other well and, among us, I\'m sure a leader will emerge,\" added Mr Ong, who has been tipped as a potential candidate for the position, along with Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat and Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Chan Chun Sing. Mr Ong was speaking on the sidelines of \"We Care\", an annual event by the North West Community Development Council to promote the culture of giving back to the community.

Ancient trade between India and countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand is well-documented. Southeast Asian cultures, traditions and languages have been profoundly influenced by these early linkages. We see Indic Hindu-Buddhist influences in historical sites such as the Angkor Temple Complex near Siem Reap in Cambodia, the Borobudor and Prambanan temples near Yogyakarta in Indonesia, and the ancient candis in Kedah in Malaysia. The Ramayana is embedded in many Southeast Asian cultures, including in Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand. Singapore’s Malay name is Singapura, derived from Sanskrit and meaning lion city. 25 YEARS OF COOPERATION Advertisement Advertisement Singapore has always advocated India’s inclusion in the ASEAN Community. India became an ASEAN Sectoral Dialogue Partner in 1992, a full ASEAN Dialogue Partner in 1995, and participated in the East Asia Summits (EAS) from 2005. The EAS is a key component of an open, inclusive and robust regional architecture, and the region’s main strategic Leaders-led forum. ASEAN-India relations were further elevated to a strategic partnership in 2012, the 20th anniversary of ASEAN-India relations. Today, ASEAN and India enjoy multi-faceted cooperation across ASEAN’s political-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Act East policy and 3-C (Commerce, Connectivity, Culture) formula for strengthening engagement with ASEAN speaks to our broad-based cooperation. We have around 30 platforms for cooperation, including an annual Leaders’ Summit and seven Ministerial Dialogues. India has participated actively in ASEAN-led platforms including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus and the East Asia Summit. With the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA), ASEAN-India trade has risen steadily from US$2.9 billion in 1993 to US$58.4 billion in 2016. On the socio-cultural front, programmes like the ASEAN-India Students Exchange Programmes and the annual Delhi Dialogue foster closer people-to-people relations. Through these platforms, our youth, academics and businessmen get to meet, learn and deepen ties. To mark this Silver Jubilee of ASEAN-India relations, both sides have held many commemorative activities. The recent Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognised the contributions of the Indian diaspora. Today’s ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit marks the culmination of these celebrations. It is an honour for all the ASEAN Leaders to be in New Delhi for this occasion. ASEAN Leaders are also deeply honoured to be invited as Chief Guests at tomorrow’s 69th Republic Day Parade. SHIFTING STRATEGIC BALANCE Major global trends are reshaping the strategic outlook, presenting both challenges and opportunities. The strategic balance is shifting. Demographic, cultural and political changes are underway in many parts of the world. The consensus on globalisation and free trade is fraying, but the Asian story continues to be a positive one. We need to push on with economic integration. We must also be resolute in dealing with emerging transboundary challenges, including terrorism, cybercrime and climate change. This geopolitical uncertainty gives new impetus to ASEAN’s cooperation with key partners like India. ASEAN and India share common interests in peace and security in the region, and an open, balanced and inclusive regional architecture. India is located strategically along major sea lanes from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. These sea lanes are also vital trade routes for many ASEAN Member States. Both sides share an interest in preserving these vital maritime conduits of trade. ASEAN and India’s combined population of 1.8 billion represents one quarter of the world’s population. Our combined GDP exceeds US$4.5 trillion. By 2025, India’s consumer market is expected to become the fifth largest in the world, while in Southeast Asia middle-class households will double to 163 million. Both regions are also experiencing a demographic dividend – 60 per cent of ASEAN’s population is below 35 years old, while India is projected to be the world’s youngest country with an average age of 29 by 2020. ASEAN and India also have fast-growing internet user bases, which will help us to grow the digital economy. THREE PROMISING AREAS Against this backdrop, we still have much scope to grow our ties – India accounted for only 2.6 per cent of ASEAN’s external trade in 2016. May I suggest three promising areas of mutually beneficial collaboration. First, ASEAN and India should redouble efforts to promote trade and investment. We need to keep existing pathways up to date and relevant, including the AIFTA. We should work together to conclude a high quality Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), surpassing the existing AIFTA. This would create an integrated Asian market comprising nearly half the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP. Streamlining rules and regulations will stimulate investments in both directions, complement India’s Act East policy and facilitate Made in India exports to the region. Second, our people will benefit greatly from greater land, air and maritime connectivity. We appreciate India’s efforts to improve land connectivity, including the extension of the trilateral India-Myanmar-Thailand Highway, and India’s US$1 billion line of credit to promote infrastructure connectivity with ASEAN. We look forward to working closely with India to boost our physical connectivity, including by expeditiously concluding the ASEAN-India Air Transport Agreement. This will enhance people-to-people flows across the region and help both Indian and ASEAN carriers to tap new and emerging markets, especially for business, investment and tourism. Digital connectivity is another important area of cooperation, and can shape people-to-people connections for the future. India’s Aadhaar system creates many new opportunities, for instance, to harmonise our fintech platforms or connect e-payment systems. Finally, we continue to look for new synergies. One objective of Singapore’s Chairmanship is to develop an ASEAN Smart Cities Network, and here Singapore and India are natural partners. India is rapidly urbanising and has set itself a goal of establishing 100 Smart Cities. Singapore, an urbanised city-state, is ready to partner India on this journey and help develop urban solutions based on our own experience. Andhra Pradesh’s new capital city of Amaravati is one example. As ASEAN Chair, Singapore is committed to deepening ASEAN-India ties. If both sides use our historical and cultural links to tackle today’s challenges and build bridges for the future, our youth and next generation stand to gain the most.

Aside from the smell of raw meat and blood, I was worried about a butcher’s knife slipping in my wet hands with disastrous consequences. I decided that I would count my experience as positive if I completed my stint with all my fingers intact. Standing in front of a wooden chopping block, with a huge, 1.5kg stainless steel meat cleaver in one hand while holding a 30cm-long lump of beef in place with the other, I braced myself for the worst. I had already botched a prior attempt due to my caution and nervousness. It was time to be bold and wield the huge blade with a degree of force and confidence! It was a simple task in principle: Cut the big lump of meat into several medium-sized portions that customers can use for their daily needs. Chopping up beef cubes to size. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) However, to actually do it with the necessary force was a significant challenge. “This is it, this is it,” I told myself, as I hesitated nervously while trying not to mangle and destroy any more valuable meat. Advertisement Advertisement Mustering as much dexterity and power as possible, I heaved the blade down with more force than my earlier try, as metal and stubborn meat collided with a dull thud on the wooden board. “Success!” I exclaimed, admiring the clean incision on the meat from the good cut. Upon closer inspection, however, I was also millimetres away from lopping off my left index finger. Sensing the close shave from just over my shoulder, fellow meat stall assistant Mr Roslan intervened and relieved me of my chopper. He then wielded it with a level of confidence and competence that only a man with three decades of experience could possess, as he expertly diced up the remaining meat slabs into neat pieces in under a minute. A DYING TRADE? The inherent risk of handling sharp knives as well as having to be on your feet for a seven-hour stretch are just some of the reasons dissuading people from venturing into the meat business, my boss at the stall told me. “I would say that cutting raw mutton would be the most difficult as its texture is tough,” said owner Rasheed of Rasheed Meat House at Sengkang New Market. “It requires some skill to it, and for me, I took at least five months to learn how to carve away mutton fat.” Revealing a 2cm-long scar near the tip of his left index finger, the 43-year-old meat merchant explained: “As you can see, there are instances where I accidentally injured my finger on the job. Even though you\'re alert, the stress from dealing with many customers in addition to exhaustion from waking up early - all it takes is just one moment to be lulled into carelessness.\" He added that the risks and the endless early mornings mean that not many people want to venture into this trade. Laying out the beef for display. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) According to the National Environment Agency (NEA), the number of NEA-licensed market produce hawkers suffered a 12 per cent decline in the past decade. It fell from 6,264 wet market hawkers in 2006 to 5,485 in 2016. It is a trend that is unlikely to improve in the future, according to Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Assistant Professor Charlene Chen. “Most wet market stalls are family-run businesses. With increasing education among the children of these stallholders, succession has become a problem,” she said. “Furthermore, given the physical labour and odd hours involved, fewer people are willing to work in this line.” This means that many stallholders end up closing their business for good when they cannot cope with the daily demands, said the Nanyang Business School lecturer. Having inherited his late father’s stall in Jurong a number of years back, Rasheed is something of an anomaly. “I was formerly from the aviation industry and back then it didn’t cross my mind to take over my dad’s business. I found his job smelly and not as glamourous as my work back then,” he said. “When my father got sick (before his death), I helped out and found that I was quite good at cutting meat.” Doing reasonably well after taking over the business, he then decided to expand about a year ago by buying another wet market meat stall in Sengkang. “I find that the money is better than my previous job,” said the former air steward. “For the Sengkang stall especially, being the only halal meat stall at the wet market, I’d say that the customer traffic is not too bad,” he added. A SLOWING BUSINESS During my stint as a butcher’s assistant over two weekdays, I estimated there were about a hundred customers each day, most of whom were maids and senior citizens. I also observed that quite a number of Filipino and Chinese expatriates - who presumably live around Sengkang - patronise the stall for their meat needs. Younger Singaporeans were, however, thin on the ground, and this presents another challenge for wet market stallholders. “It’s quite uncommon to find young Singaporeans buying meat from wet markets these days,” observed stall assistant Majid Babu, 60, who has been a butcher for over four decades. “It’s usually the elderly plus a good number of Chinese and Filipino foreigners, who are more familiar and used to wet market shopping.” Having worked at other meat stalls in his career, Mr Majid recalled how things were in the 1970s before supermarkets became so widespread. “In those days, and even in the years before that, the wet market business was booming,” he said. “Stall owners ruled the roost – if a customer bargained too low, some sellers would even be fierce enough to toss the goods in their direction and tell them to take it or leave it. One of the basic skills of the job involves cutting a whole chicken into 14 parts. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) “Nowadays, there are fewer wet markets in Singapore and even relatively newer ones have closed down. A good example is the market next to Pasir Ris West Plaza, where I used to work. It opened only about 20 years ago, and recently closed down to make way for a bigger supermarket,” he said. It is the cleanliness and convenience of supermarkets that have spelled the end for a good number of wet market hawkers, according to Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) School of Business Management deputy manager James Sim. “The trend is in favour of supermarket chains. Singaporeans enjoy being able to purchase everything they need easily in a comfortable environment – air-conditioned and very sanitised,” he said. “Popular eateries and other retail outlets are also located in malls where the supermarkets are – making it a winning combination, especially during the weekend. As such, this trend is likely to continue,” he added. CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE Still, the social aspect of shopping in a wet market is arguably something that supermarkets struggle to reproduce and remains a key advantage for many customers. When I mistakenly placed chicken gizzards instead of chicken hearts into a plastic bag for weighing, I was met with chuckles and facepalms from a customer. “You’ve got to forgive him. It’s his first time at the job,” said stall assistant Mr Roslan as he came to my rescue once again. “Ah, it’s okay … you’ll be an expert in no time lah, bro. I\'m sure of it,” replied the customer, amicably calming my self-doubt as he handed me payment for his rectified order. Packing meat pieces to sell to a customer. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) One-on-one interactions like this are commonplace in wet markets. Often filled with the sounds of merchants wooing customers and shoppers haggling for a bargain, these experiences are hard to reproduce among the ordered shelves of supermarkets. “Customers in the neighbourhood who regularly patronise certain stalls form lasting relationships with the stall holders, and appreciate the friendly and personalised service,” said Nanyang Business School lecturer Prof Chen. She added: “Additionally, wet markets provide a very unique sensory and cultural experience. The sights, sounds, and smells give a sense of nostalgia. You can see different cultures coming together and mingling in these common spaces - an exemplification of our multi-cultural society.” Playing an important role in the community, wet markets used to be a hive of social activity as new friends were made while families bonded over morning trips to get groceries. “(Wet markets) were a cornerstone of community life in Singapore – a place where people would spend time together with their friends and loved ones as they did their errands,” said NYP School of Business Management lecturer Mr Sim. “It still plays a huge part for a large section of baby boomers.” He added: “The social role played by the wet market will diminish over time as the demographics of Singapore change. The declining population of baby boomers who form a large percentage of wet market customers will possibly reduce the significance of the role that wet market plays socially. “Culturally, it is important to acknowledge that wet markets play an important role so that the younger generation can still appreciate its existence.” WILL WET MARKETS BECOME EXTINCT? Despite some doubts about the long-term future of wet markets, they still offer advantages over their cleaner, cooler supermarket rivals, especially when it comes to cost. Having reached inside the refrigerated display to grab two slabs of beef shin, I laid them out on the counter for an elderly Chinese customer who wanted to inspect the quality before buying. With my limited command of Mandarin, I showed her a S$10 note, together with four S$2 notes to communicate the price. After she had made her choice, I then packed the beef shin – also known as ‘golden coin muscle’ - into a yellow plastic bag and exchanged it with two S$10 notes she handed over. “Thank you very much,” I replied in broken Mandarin, as I handed over her change. A popular meat cut among Chinese and Filipino customers, beef shin can be more costly for customers who do not buy from wet markets. “You can check in supermarkets – you’ll find that they sell (golden coin) muscles for S$24,” said stall owner Rasheed. “Here it’s only S$18, and you can observe many Chinese and Filipino buyers who purchase it to cook stew. “For wet market stalls, our overhead costs are not as high as that of supermarkets. That is why we can price certain things cheaper,” added Rasheed, whose stall rental in Sengkang is S$10,000 per month. “I also only choose the best brands of meat to sell, based on my years of experience. Many customers return because they get the best and tastiest cuts from my shop,” he said. Despite rising competition from supermarkets, Rasheed believes such dynamics account for the survival of wet markets in Singapore in the modern era. “People will continue to shop at wet markets because it involves a simple transaction that is easy for all ages – you can choose what you want based on quality, you pay in cash immediately, and you’re done,” he said. Weighing out chicken pieces for sale to a customer. (Photo: Hanidah Amin) As such, wet markets are here to stay for the moment at least, according to Nanyang Business School’s Prof. Chen. “Many people living in Singapore, including expatriates, still see the benefits of buying their produce and goods from wet markets,” she said. “Items from wet markets are perceived to be cheaper and fresher. “I foresee that stall numbers will continue to dwindle, but given current efforts to conserve wet markets and their longstanding appeal among many consumers and visitors, I doubt they will disappear completely,” she added. Armed with improved knife-handling skills and a better insight into the meat business, I could not help but wonder if I would make a good butcher who could somehow arrest the falling numbers.

The birth of Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, two identical long-tailed macaques, made them the first primates to be have been cloned using the same technique that produced Dolly the sheep two decades ago. The experiment has been hailed for breaking a key technical barrier with the potential of furthering human disease research. But it has also raised ethical concerns, with critics arguing that this could possibly be one step closer to human cloning. \"We have no plan to clone humans, and social ethics would by no means allow that practice,\" Xinhua cited Muming Poo, co-author of the macaque study, as saying. While theoretically humans can be cloned, said Poo, who directs the Institute of Neuroscience (ION) and Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research is aimed at better understanding and treating human brain diseases, such as the Alzheimer\'s and autism.

He was crying. His concerned mother asked why. “I said, \'Mum, I have never heard anything so beautiful in my life.\' I decided then that I wanted to be a professional musician and more skilled towards jazz,” he tells me during our interview. When I ask him what he was listening to, he pauses. For a moment, I feel he might start crying right there in front of me. But he doesn’t. Instead he tells me with a faraway look on his face - as if he were again listening to the jazz record that made him decide the course of the rest of his life - Brown Ballad composed by Ray Brown, performed by Quincy Jones, featuring Toots Thielemans on the harmonica. “Just the way Toots was playing the harmonica. The whole thing was so beautiful, the melodic lines were so impeccable.” Advertisement Advertisement About 30 years later, he would share the stage with Thielemans at the Victoria Concert Hall as part of the Singapore Arts Festival.

(Photo: Jeremy Monteiro) Dubbed Singapore’s King of Swing, Mr Monteiro, a jazz pianist, singer and composer, has won multiple awards including the Cultural Medallion in 2002 and performed with jazz greats such as James Moody, Ernie Watts and Lee Ritenour. He is also known for composing National Day songs such as One People, One Nation, One Singapore. Today, he performs at festivals and jazz clubs all over the world and produces albums for himself and others. In fact, he will be producing Laura Fygi’s next album. SERENDIPITY Mr Monteiro shot to international fame with his 1988 performance at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. “Although I played for only one night, the coverage in Singapore across many media lasted almost eight months. This allowed me to suddenly come to the forefront of the collective consciousness.” He was the first Southeast Asian musician to perform with an American band on the main stage of an international jazz festival. “It was serendipity. It just so happened that the Montreux festival director was having a meal at a cafe where they were playing an album of mine. He heard it and said, \'We must get this guy\'.\" At that point he was a nobody. He was part of a band, Monteiro, Young and Holt. Young and Holt were the original drummer and bass player in the Grammy award-winning Ramsey Lewis Trio from the US. “They started to come to Singapore in the 80s. When they came over, I started playing with them and I asked them to form a project band with me.” Monteiro, Young and Holt received a three-minute standing ovation at Montreux.

(Photo: Jeremy Monteiro) He hadn’t imagined any of this when at 16 he decided he was done with school. “I was a decent student until I hit secondary 3. At that point, I started to become very interested in music.” He had been taking music lessons since he was seven years old and music was an intrinsic part of family life. His father, a policeman, moonlighted as a jazz guitar player. He would have jam sessions at home and bought jazz records that would fill the house with melodies practically all day. “I was trained in classical piano, but I loved jazz more because I could extemporise, improvise. It was a wonderful mode of expression for me. “I can’t really explain it. Playing music centres me. It allows me to to feel a congruency between my mind, body and soul. Instrumental music especially is the language of the heart. It allows me to communicate without saying a word.” HIS DAD “SABOTAGED” HIM While his dad was a musician, his son’s ambitions to go into music full-time made him nervous because “it wasn’t an easy life.” “He started to sabotage me in the best possible way, wanting me to concentrate on my studies. He said he’d send me to the best university if I did well for my O-level and A-level exams. I deliberately didn’t do well at O-levels because I didn’t want to go any further.” When asked if he felt any fear taking what’s deemed to be a risky path in a Singapore that emphasises academic excellence, he says, “No, I didn’t feel any fear. Maybe it was just youth.” His fearlessness paid off. He committed himself fully and did just fine, starting as a musician at Chinese nightclubs to pay the bills. His mother was pivotal in his entry into jazz clubs in Singapore. She was a private nurse to an old man who had just had heart surgery at the time. “He owned a club and when she told him I was a jazz pianist, he gave me a job.” For many years, Mr Monteiro was a session pianist and performed on more than 300 pop records. GENERATIONS OF JOBLESS MUSICIANS While Mr Monteiro still makes “decent money” doing jazz gigs, both overseas and in Singapore at corporate events and clubs, he bemoans the dearth of jazz clubs in Singapore. Many have closed over the years. “The Government has done amazing things with education. Having things like School of the Arts, and La-Salle and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. My worry is that a lot of musicians who graduate from these institutions end up having no gigs. They just have nowhere to play. They’re jobless. “I\'m already established so I can get jobs overseas and at functions in Singapore. But all these musicians, who need a foundation of performing on home soil, will be coming out with their degrees or diplomas in music and what they end up doing is going back to teach the next generation of jobless musicians. Do we really want to drive all of them overseas?” Perhaps there is no demand for jazz musicians, which would explain the club closures. “Well, people started getting more distracted. There are so many things you can do at home now to entertain yourself.” But he believes that if live entertainment were to be made available in heartland neighbourhoods, there would be a healthy demand. “Nowadays, we have new towns that have everything. So of course, people don’t want to leave their neighbourhoods.” LOOSEN PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT LICENSE RULES “If we made live entertainment available at neighbourhood cafes and restaurants, I’m sure people would go. Our public entertainment license restrictions need to be loosened.” There are obstacles. “Within neighbourhoods, they worry about noise. There was one case of noise complaints from a particular establishment. They had some problems with licensing after that. But when I went to investigate, you couldn’t hear the music from outside the club. It was because at midnight, for some reason, everybody spilled over to the front of the club, and started making a whole lot of noise. The complaints were because of these people. “So you should control the crowd that’s making noise. Maybe don’t serve alcohol at these establishments. But don’t control the bands, and the licenses.” He’s deeply frustrated by this issue which he deems a “failing of our scene.” “Our public entertainment rules and regulations are actually meant really for a time when there were gangsters in Singapore and girly bars and so on. Today, we have a different scene where there are also things like folk music places or jazz places that we can have. Provisions need to be made for these all over Singapore.” Jeremy Monteiro performs all over the world, from Bangkok to New York. (Photo: Norhendra Ruslan) This is especially important because making money out of CD sales is not lucrative anymore, he points out. He rails against piracy and even music services like Spotify. “It’s the lesser of two evils, but it’s still institutionalised piracy because the songs are going for a very low fee.” But some have argued that piracy may not be such a bad thing. It at least increases exposure and that exposure generates more in terms of concert ticket or merchandise sales. “Generally, people need to understand that to take someone’s music for free is the equivalent of walking into someone’s house and walking out with their things. We feel violated as artistes, musicians or filmmakers when people steal our work like that.” What’s the solution then? “The Government is doing things like blocking sites. It’s a bit of a cat-and-mouse game but I think they’re very much on it. They should be even more stringent because entertainment could actually be a huge part of the economy.” To do his part to support the local jazz scene, he has started the Jazz Association of Singapore. He’s rallying to bring jazz to the neighbourhoods and launching a scholarship programme for young artistes. They also have an orchestra mentored by Grammy award-winning musicians and mentors. THE LAST EMPEROR OF JINGLES Mr Monteiro’s talent goes beyond jazz. “In the past, at any one time, there would always be someone who had about 70% of the jingles market. In the early 80s, it was me. It helped me pay for my \'jazz habit\'. I had the means to, if there were a jazz festival somewhere in French Riviera, jump into the plane and go and listen.” But even though he never saw jingle production as a passion, he put his all into it. “My mindset was: I will produce the most amazing piece of music ever written in the history of mankind. That’s how I approach everything. Of course, after I walked out of the studio, I would just forget about what I did because that wasn’t really my artistic expression. But thankfully, even throughout my jingle career and my pop session work, I would go to my jazz gigs at night. These made me decent money too.” His reign in the jingles production market came to an end after 10 years. “Computer music started coming around and people could actually set up little bedroom studios. Many came from overseas too. That was the end of being able to have dominance.” Hence he became known as “The Last Emperor of Jingles”. He stopped altogether in the early 90s to focus fully on his jazz career and continued releasing albums. In fact, one of his first few, Faces and Places, outsold saxophonist, Kenny G’s album in Singapore in 1987. FEELING FEAR While he didn’t feel any fear as a teenager starting an unconventional career, Mr Monteiro did feel fear as an adult. Between 1981 and 1991, he opened and closed seven recording studios. “When I started getting really successful in jingles, I realised I didn’t like paying tens of thousands of dollars to recording studios every month. So I wanted to have my own. I would always find means to open the next one, maybe bigger and with better facilities. But the seventh one was bad. It was more than half a million dollars of investments and then, all of a sudden, my business went away because of the new production houses from overseas that opened here.“ He had about S$800,000 worth of debt and spent 10 years paying it off. “I feared not being able to provide for my family, but we managed being very, very frugal.” Today, he owns Showtime Productions, which is a business vehicle for his activities. It books musicians for corporate functions and conventions and represent artistes. While the business failures were painful, Monteiro says his childhood experience made it easier for him to accept a frugal lifestyle. His father opened up a successful business after he retired from the police force. “He got quite wealthy to a point where I remember we used to have two drivers in the family. One for him and my mum and one for me and my sister, Sheila. We’d go school in a chauffeur-driven car. But then the business took a turn for the worse and all that went away.” “It was a culture shock. We moved from a big house to a small apartment. From travelling in a chauffeur-driven car to taking bus number 209 from our flat in Taman Jurong to school.” It wasn’t tough for long though. “I got over it. I remembered what my uncle said. As long as you have enough to eat, a comfortable bed to sleep in and a piano to practise on, it’s enough.” “I’ve been made to feel humble many, many times and nowadays I never just judge a book by its cover. Some unassuming fella could jump at the piano and just kick your butt!\" says Jeremy Monteiro. (Photo: Jeremy Monteiro) NO GRAMMY OR OSCAR The young Monteiro had bold ambitions. He wanted to win a Grammy and an Oscar for scoring a Hollywood film. But none of this happened. \"I’ve only reached the entry stage of the Grammy Awards which is just below nomination. “The one time I had a chance to do a score for a Hollywood B-movie, the project didn’t go ahead.” Indeed, a lot has been said about Monteiro having performed with the greats of the scene, but why hasn’t he managed to become one of them in terms of recognition? Was he just not good enough? “At one point there were some people who wanted to try to help me be nominated for a Grammy. When I listened to what the process was all about, how political it was and how much money you needed just to get nominated - you have to have at least S$35,000 dollars to spend on PR agents and to even be heard - I thought to myself, do I really want to spend that kind of money?” But why not? Isn’t that kind of recognition worth it? “At that time, I didn’t have the money to even think about doing stuff like that and now, I wouldn’t want to waste my money on that anymore.” “I don’t really care about being famous anymore. I’m happy with being recognised in this region. Most people start off with just loving the music and then they move on later on become more commercial. I’ve actually gone the other way.” I ask if he fears that his not caring about being famous would be seen as as excuse for simply not being good enough. “But the thing that drives me to write, play and practice is totally different now. It’s no longer those things. Now my impetus is just really to produce the best possible music that I can produce. I’m lucky enough now where there’s a flow, there’s enough of an income that I don’t really worry so much about awards. I just completely feel in love with music again. ” OUR COLONIAL HANG-UP However, the lack of recognition of local musicians on home soil bothers him. He attributes it to Singaporeans’ “colonial hang-up”. “Some bands in the past had a good run. But even then, sales were not fantastic, not like those for American artistes.” This unfortunately extends to all other products as well. Two years ago, he launched J Monteiro watches in celebration of his 40th anniversary in music. “I went in with a very prominent Singaporean watch maker who has got an international brand that’s now global. When we started off, we were struggling but the moment we decided to move our manufacturing from Hong Kong and Singapore to Germany, our sales went up because of the \'Made in Germany\' mark.” \"You might be able to find quick fame, but if you’re not ready to put in the work for the long-term, you won’t get anywhere,\" says Jeremy Monteiro. (Photo: Jeremy Monteiro) GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO REACH OUT TO ARTISTS There are many other positives in Singapore though. He praises the Government’s efforts to support the arts. “Things like the Arts Creation Grant are unheard of in some countries.” However, he says the grants application process, while less onerous than before, is still an issue. “It’s still quite onerous. So sometimes the people who get the grants are not those who necessarily deserve it, but those who are really clever at filling up forms.” Mr Monteiro feels the authorities could also afford to boost outreach efforts. “An old artist with a lot of talent who spends a lot of time in his studio may not be aware of your grants. So have an arts officer go and help these artists.” However, hardship is par for the course, he says. “In New York, the best actors on Broadway and off Broadway are waiting tables two-thirds of the time to pay their bills. It’s part of journey. When you get better, you’ll make more.” \"Complaining doesn’t do any good. You’ve really got to just get on with it.” LEARNING LESSONS AND MAKING AN IMPACT “With social media these days, a lot of people survive on the dopamine rush of \'likes\'. You might be able to find quick fame, but if you’re not ready to put in the work for the long-term, you won’t get anywhere. It’s a lesson many artistes learn.” He himself has learnt many over the years including humility. “I’ve learnt to remember that we are masters of our own level. Nothing more, nothing less. There will always be people who are much better than you are. “I’ve been made to feel humble many, many times and nowadays I never just judge a book by its cover. Some unassuming fella could jump at the piano and just kick your butt!” While he’s proud of his musical career, he does have some regrets. One of them is having lost money in his production businesses. “I would actually be quite rich now if not for the fact that at some point I lost everything, lost all my money, almost lost my home. I think to myself, why did this happen? Why did I have to suffer this?” He quickly turns this around though. “Maybe the universe designed this to happen because I’m actually, by nature, quite a lazy person. If I were rich, if I had won the lottery or if I had never lost any money, I’d be sitting on a pile of cash now, but I would not have done all the things that I’ve done and I would not have worked so hard to create music, to reach out to audiences.” When asked about the proudest moment of his career so far, Mr Monteiro struggles. “Having done this for over 40 years, I really can’t remember everything. Sometimes the best performances happen in an empty jazz club late at night when there are only six people listening to you. Someone in the audience of six could be tearing because they loved the way you played a ballad.” No doubt, Jeremy Monteiro wants to continue having this impact on others, similar to the impact his idol, Toots Thielemans had on him more than 40 years ago.

A Philippine lawyer filed the complaint against Duterte at the world\'s only permanent war crimes court nearly 10 months ago, alleging his anti-crime crackdown has caused some 8,000 deaths. The Hague-based tribunal\'s prosecutor has recently notified the Philippine embassy there it is opening a \"preliminary examination\" on the case, Duterte spokesman Harry Roque told reporters Thursday. \"We view of course this decision of the prosecutor as a waste of time and resources,\" Roque said, adding that Duterte holds he merely employed \"lawful use of force\" against threats to the state and its citizens. The ICC spokesman contacted by AFP would not confirm the information, and there was no immediate response to AFP\'s inquiries from the prosecutor\'s office. Duterte won a landslide victory in the 2016 elections largely on a pledge to kill tens of thousands of criminals and eradicate drugs in Philippine society. Advertisement Advertisement He has since overseen a crackdown that has left nearly 4,000 drug suspects dead at the hands of the police. The authorities are also investigating more than 2,000 other cases of \"drug-related\" killings by unknown suspects. Rights groups put the total number of drug war deaths as at least twice the official figure, many of them committed by shadowy vigilantes. Police insist they only shot armed suspects in self-defence. Jude Sabio, the Filipino lawyer behind the suit, told AFP he was \"elated\" and \"vindicated\" by the prosecutor\'s action, adding the court usually threw out many other complaints brought before it. \"This is a big step because finally the system of death squad killings created by Duterte ... can be investigated,\" Sabio said, adding he hoped it would lead to Duterte\'s arrest. But Roque said the Philippine mission will tell the court it has no jurisdiction over the case because the tribunal was intended as a \"court of last resort\" and the Philippine courts were fully functioning. \"No one should claim a victory because we are only in the stage of preliminary examination,\" Roque said, accusing the political opposition of being behind Sabio\'s suit. \"Obviously this is intended to embarrass the president. But the president is a lawyer, he knows what the procedures are. They will fail,\" said Roque, a former law professor. But Roque also said Duterte welcomed the development. \"He\'s sick and tired of being accused of committing crimes against humanity,\" Roque said. \"The president has said that if need be, he will argue his case personally before the International Criminal Court,\" the spokesman added.

Shiffrin reeled off five consecutive World Cup victories to start 2018, but has since managed to only stand on the podium once in her last four outings, something compatriot Miller puts down to fatigue. \"She came in so fast and so strong from the pre-season, and all of her preparation was perfect,\" Miller told Reuters at his hotel in Pyeongchang, where he will work for broadcasters NBC and Eurosport as an analyst during the Games. \"And then on the road, racing every weekend and sometimes in the middle of the week, and training the whole time, sometimes you end up getting a little bit worn down,\" he explained. Miller represented the U.S. at five Olympics and became the oldest Alpine skier to medal when he won bronze in the Super G at the Sochi Games in 2014. The outspoken 40-year-old said that Shiffrin might have been better off taking a few weeks off coming into the Olympics to give herself a chance to rest before carrying the considerable medal expectations of American fans.

You have to manage yourself.\" Miller\'s six medals, including gold in the super combined at the 2010 Vancouver Games, make him the most successful American Olympic skier in history, but the 22-year-old Shiffrin, who already has a gold of her own, could easily eclipse him. MILLER TIME What set her apart was not just her technique, but her physical power, according to Miller. \"I mean, the reality is that she doesn\'t beat girls by much at the top of the course... it\'s really at the bottom of the course that she tends to excel and move away from everyone else,\" he said. \"I think what separates her from everyone else is her fitness, she\'s able to stay at that high level all the way through to the finish, with no drop-off at all. \"I\'ve seen it a lot - she\'s good at the top, she\'s good in the middle and then she crushes everybody on the bottom.\" Having officially retired last October, Miller is enjoying the switch from skier to broadcaster, as well as building his business interests outside of sport and taking care of his growing family. His horse-breeding business is starting to mature, and with his Aztec clothing and Bomber skis, the one-time free spirit of the slopes seems to be becoming more comfortable in the boardroom. \"I do all the normal stuff, board meetings and budgeting, marketing and manufacturing, and distribution,\" he said. \"I have four kids and I try to play golf every once in a while. It\'s busy, but this is actually kind of a break, to come to the Olympics.\" An avid hockey fan, Miller says he expects the Americans to top the medals table, led by his former Alpine skiing team mates. \"I think the women will have to carry us - certainly, Lindsey (Vonn) and Mikaela are two powerhouses there. They\'re capable of winning five, six, seven medals between them,\" he said.

But after months of scares and setbacks, the 20-year-old is set to compete at a second Winter Games she considers more significant than ever. \"I had no idea what was going to happen this season,\" Daleman told reporters after practicing at the Gangneung Ice Arena, describing her \"brutal summer\" filled with health issues. \"This Olympics means more to me than anything because I went from not knowing if I\'d be able to skate this year to do what I\'m doing.\" Daleman, who finished 17th at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, said the recovery time for the surgery she had in May was usually eight months. She took only half of that time off. In recent months, Daleman, who won bronze at last year\'s world championships, has opened up about a plethora of issues she has faced off the ice. Advertisement Advertisement She has a learning disability that causes her trouble with reading and writing, something that led to bullying at an early age. As a former gymnast, Daleman does not have the stereotypical skating body. Her muscles bulge. Her shoulders are broader than the average skater\'s. She is strong. But the pressure of striving for a lithe frame has taken its toll. Daleman revealed that she has suffered from an eating disorder like the ones that have ended the careers of many female skaters her age. \"Not only athletes but a lot of women and a lot of people do struggle with most of the stuff I was struggling with and I still do on a day-to-day basis,\" Daleman said. \"I shouldn\'t be ashamed to tell people what I\'ve been through and what I\'m going through because it\'s life and it brought me to where and who I am today.\" Eating disorders have long been an issue in figure skating. U.S. skater Gracie Gold announced last year she would be missing the Olympics as she was taking a break to treat psychological issues and an eating disorder. Sochi team gold medallist Yulia Lipnitskaya, 19, retired from the sport after undergoing treatment for anorexia. PROGRAMME CHANGES The upheaval in Daleman\'s life has been matched by a shake-up in her free programme. But the changes, she said, were meant to better reflect her genuine self. In the midst of the competitive season last autumn, Daleman dropped her long programme with music from the \"Gladiator\" movie, a risky move so close to the Olympics. But that programme, she said, just didn\'t feel right. After consulting with her coaches, Daleman decided to revive her long programme from last season, when she skated to George Gershwin\'s \"Rhapsody in Blue\". To work on freshening up her old free skate, Daleman pulled out of a challenge event going into Canadian national championships and spent a month perfecting her routine. Her short programme - which she skates to music from \"Carmen\" - remains untouched. \"I couldn\'t be happier with it,\" Daleman said of her free skate. \"It\'s just more playful. It\'s more me, me personally. The short is me, I\'m sassy. The long is me, I\'m playful. It was just what was best for me and what I felt more comfortable.\" Daleman did not set any specific goals post-recovery. In Pyeongchang, she wants to show how far she has come. \"I\'m very happy going into this competition and just showing everyone how hard I\'ve been working,\" Daleman said.

Kaplan, a non-voting member of the Fed\'s policy committee, predicted that unemployment would dip below 4 percent this year, suggesting stress in the labor market. \"2018 will be a strong year in the United States,\" Kaplan said. \"Our Dallas Fed forecasts for GDP were somewhere between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent.\" \"We think we’re at or near full employment in the U.S..
